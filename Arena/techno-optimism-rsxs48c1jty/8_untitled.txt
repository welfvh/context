"E/acc is for builders taking back the reins from their own culture’s indefinite impulses; a reassertion of control over the past decade of wholly inadequate journalism, meek corporate infiltration of tech, and thoughtless grifters. It is a clear affirmation that without technologists, solving the world’s hardest problems – clean energy, human aging and disease, transportation – is hopeless. E/accs feel no shame in hope and excitement about the future, and they refuse to let the pessimists win."
