> **The wetiko nature of modern capitalism:** its insatiable hunger for finite resources; its disregard for the pain of the groups and cultures it consumes; its belief in consumption as saviour; its overriding obsession with its own material growth; and its viral spread across the surface of the planet. It is wholly accurate to describe neoliberal capitalism as the primary cannibal- ising force of life on this planet. It is not the only truth – capitalism has also facilitated an explosion of human life and ingenuity – but when taken as a whole, capitalism is certainly eating through the life force of this planet in service of its own growth.
