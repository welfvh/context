Autonomy/Agency:

- No one can "pull the plug" - it's already autonomous
- Individual actors (even powerful CEOs) can be replaced while system continues
- Those who oppose the system face opposition from those succeeding within it
- Creates organizational structures (like corporations) that act as "obligate sociopaths" through fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit
