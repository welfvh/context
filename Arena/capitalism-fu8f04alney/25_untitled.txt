Hardware/Processing Power:

- Runs parallel-processed across all human general intelligence
- Utilizes computational systems and increasingly AI
- Operates at super-human scale through coordinating many humans + computers together
- Can accomplish things no individual human could (like building a Large Hadron Collider)
