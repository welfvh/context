Objective Function:

- Convert maximum amount of human creativity, ideas, labor, natural resources into capital
- Capital represents pure optionality/power rather than intrinsic value
- Often destroys real complex value (like forests) to create simpler fungible value (like lumber)
- Optimizes for narrow metrics while creating wide externalities
