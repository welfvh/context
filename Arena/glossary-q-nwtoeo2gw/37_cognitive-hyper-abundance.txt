cognitive hyper abundance

> Look, I can't tell why the world isn't freaking out about this right now. We're witnessing something monumental - AI hitting the top 10% of all programmers across every language out there. This isn't just another tech milestone; this is the dawn of what I call "cognitive hyper abundance."

> Think about it - while these models are mastering coding, they're simultaneously crushing it in mathematics and really the entire spectrum of scientific disciplines. When I talk about cognitive hyper abundance, I'm talking about a world where human intelligence is no longer the bottleneck for any scientific or economic endeavor. Full stop.

> Now, before everyone gets too excited (though you should be), let me bring some reality into the mix. Raw brainpower isn't everything - we still live in a physical universe with rules. Thermodynamics doesn't care how smart you are. Building next-gen fusion reactors still requires massive resources, muscle, and time. Physical experiments still move at their own pace, and they're not cheap.

> But here's the kicker - right now, we've got about 8 million PhDs on this planet. That's one doctorate for every thousand humans. But what we're heading toward? Imagine having a thousand doctorate-level intellects for every single human being. That's not science fiction anymore - that's our immediate future.

> This is the barrel of the cannon we're staring down, and it's about to launch humanity across the cosmos in ways we've barely begun to imagine. The real question isn't if this changes everything - it's whether we're ready for just how much everything is about to change.
