**CETAI**

Civilizationally Embedded Transformative Artificial Intelligence

Traditional conceptions of TAI tend to focus on AI systems as discrete technological innovations that transform society through their capabilities. But CETAI points to something more fundamentally entangled and systemic - it's not just about AI systems impacting civilization, but about how they become part of civilization's core optimization and coordination processes.

The key insight is that technological capitalism itself is already a kind of autonomous superintelligent system - with its emergent behaviors, optimization pressures, and coordination dynamics. As AI systems become integrated into this fabric, they don't just add new capabilities - they potentially allow us to understand, interface with, and maybe even "align" these deeper systemic processes.

So CETAI is transformative not just in the sense of adding new capabilities, but in potentially allowing us to:

- Make visible the previously invisible/unconscious optimization processes of technological capitalism
- Interface with and potentially influence these processes more directly
- Create new forms of coordination and governance at the civilizational scale

In this view, the alignment challenge isn't just about making individual AI systems behave safely - it's about the possibility of aligning the entire socioeconomic optimization system toward life-affirming ends. The AI systems are interesting precisely because they become new leverage points for affecting these deeper patterns.

This could be what makes CETAI truly transformative in a way that's different from traditional TAI concepts - not just as a new powerful technology, but as a potential interface for civilizational self-awareness and self-modification.
