Zac Stein’s notion of pre-tragic, tragic, and post-tragic

> “Briefly, in the pre-tragic station, we have either not experienced tragedy or have managed to bypass or deny it. The pre-tragic is defined by a superficial sense of clarity and certainty. In the tragic station, we acknowledge and face the tragedy of suffering but often cannot find our way beyond it, so it destroys our capacity to respond to or creativity and clarity are exploded, and all that seems to remain is a debilitating and even degrading uncertainty. In the post-tragic, we have fully faced the tragic and live within it, but are able to transcend and transform it. In the post-tragic, we move beyond the certainty of the superficial and the dogmatic and begin to directly access the deeper certainties of reality’s inherent value. And yet at the same time, we paradoxically hold the mystery. We enter a cloud of unknowning—the spiritual and even religious dignity of our uncertainty—but do not allow ourselves to be inappropriately seduced by facile certainties.”
