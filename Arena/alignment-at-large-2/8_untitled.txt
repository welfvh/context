What if we expanded our lens beyond narrow AI alignment to grapple with the full scope of what "alignment" really means? We're facing not just the challenge of aligning artificial intelligence, but the deeper question of how to align technological capitalism itself - with its unconscious optimization pressures, its coordination failures, its tendency toward extraction and nihilism - toward life-affirming possibilities. The current narrative of technological progress, with its naive assumption that more capability automatically leads to better outcomes, obscures the real work needed: understanding and transforming the fundamental dynamics that shape how technology, markets, and culture evolve.

This calls for serious research into what it would actually take to bend the arc of history toward a viable civilization. Not just technical solutions or policy tweaks, but a deep investigation of how we might consciously evolve the entire system of technology, markets, and human coordination toward life-affirming possibilities. What are the games worth playing? What are the attractors that could enable genuine transformation? How might we create conditions where wisdom becomes evolutionarily advantageous? These aren't just philosophical questions - they're practical imperatives if we hope to navigate the unprecedented challenges and possibilities before us.
