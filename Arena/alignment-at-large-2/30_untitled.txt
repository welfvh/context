given this beginning of a draft, what are the ideas I should consider for introducing the top right quadrant as the orienting directionality of Alignment At Large? starting with the high level theoretical requirements and then instantiating it with more concrete expressions, criteria for theories of change within that quadrant, and then towards these more explicitly mentioned ideas in there? this is all central to what I think belongs in that quadrant, but except for authentic progress, it all feels a bit specifically flavored and it would feel preposterous to put these early ideas with a less confident epistemic status next to a very mature critique of the top left?
