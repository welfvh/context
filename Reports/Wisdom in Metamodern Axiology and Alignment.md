# **Wisdom in Metamodern Axiology and Alignment: A Two-Part Research Report**

**Abstract:**  
 This report explores **wisdom** as a pivotal concept for human values and future development, especially within a *metamodern axiology* (an emerging framework of values beyond postmodernism) and the discourse on aligning advanced artificial intelligence (AI) with human ideals. **Part 1: Conceptualizing Wisdom** examines what wisdom is – distinguishing it from knowledge, intelligence, and skill – and surveys its philosophical, psychological, and spiritual underpinnings across cultures. We identify core attributes of wisdom (moral insight, integrative thinking, long-term perspective, compassion, etc.) and discuss how wisdom develops in individuals (drawing on cognitive science and developmental psychology theories like Kegan’s and Vervaeke’s work) and in cultures. We also explore how various wisdom traditions (e.g. Buddhist, Christian mystical, secular humanist ethics) converge in a **metamodern** context that seeks to integrate ancient insight with modern rationality. **Part 2: Applying Wisdom to Metamodern Axiology & Alignment** addresses the application of wisdom in solving contemporary “hypermodern” challenges – from systemic traps (“Moloch”-like dynamics) and engineered consumer demands to the risks of runaway technological capitalism. We analyze how the rationalist and Effective Altruist (EA) communities consider wisdom in AI **alignment** (ensuring AI systems uphold human values) and moral development. The notion of a *wisdom-guided AI* (a “Superwise” ASI) is discussed as a potential approach to safe and beneficial AI. Furthermore, we examine metamodern approaches to governance, **solarpunk** futures, and techno-humanism that aim to embed wisdom into policy, technology, and societal structures. Finally, we synthesize these threads to argue that wisdom can serve as a central organizing principle in metamodern value-systems and cultural evolution, guiding both humans and machines toward a more mature, life-affirming future.

## **Part 1: Conceptualizing Wisdom**

### **1.1 Defining Wisdom vs. Knowledge, Intelligence, and Skill**

**Knowledge**, **intelligence**, **skill**, and **wisdom** are related terms often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings. To clarify:

* **Knowledge** refers to the collection of facts, information, and understandings that a person has acquired. It is domain-specific and can be taught or learned (for example, knowing *what* something is or *how* something works). Knowledge can be theoretical or practical, and one can have extensive knowledge in a field without necessarily being wise.

* **Intelligence** generally denotes the cognitive ability to learn, reason, and solve problems. It involves raw mental capacity – pattern recognition, logical reasoning, memory, and analytical skills. Intelligence is often measured by IQ or academic success, and it emphasizes *how efficiently* someone can process information. One definition describes intelligence as “the ability to think logically, to conceptualize and abstract from reality”. In simpler terms, intelligence is a measure of *mental quickness* or problem-solving ability, often in academic or technical contexts. For instance, a person might be highly intelligent in terms of performing complex mathematical calculations or scientific reasoning.

* **Skill** is the proficiency to carry out tasks or activities. Skills are typically learned abilities in specific contexts – for example, the skill of carpentry, playing the piano, or coding in Python. Skills often require practice and indicate *know-how* – the capability to execute certain actions with competence. They are narrower than intelligence in scope (someone might have a skill in fixing engines but not be broadly “intelligent” in other areas, or vice versa). In Aristotle’s classical terms, **technē** corresponds to craft or skill – the knowledge of *how to make or do something* (e.g. the craft of building a chair). Skills and technical knowledge (technē) can exist without deep wisdom about life’s larger questions.

* **Wisdom**, in contrast to the above, implies a **deep understanding of life and the prudent application of knowledge** toward good ends. Wisdom is often defined as the capacity to make sound judgments and choices **about what matters in life**, especially in conditions of complexity or uncertainty. It is not just about knowing information (knowledge) or processing it quickly (intelligence) or executing tasks (skill), but about understanding *what knowledge is important*, *when and how to use it*, and *ultimately, what is the right or good thing to do*. One dictionary-style definition calls wisdom “knowledge of what is true or right coupled with just judgment as to action”. In essence, wisdom connects knowledge and intelligence to **values** and **ethics**: it asks *“Given what I know and can do, what should I do (for the greater good, or in the long run)?”*.

To highlight the difference: an intelligent person knows *how* to achieve goals, but a wise person discerns *which goals are worth pursuing and why*. An intelligent chess computer can calculate millions of moves (high intelligence), a knowledgeable player remembers many openings (much knowledge), a skilled player has great tactics, but a wise player understands the *psychology and ethics* of the game – for example, when to graciously offer a draw for a greater sportsmanship (applying judgment beyond raw calculation).

**Wisdom vs. Intelligence:** Academic research often contrasts wisdom and intelligence. Vivian Clayton (1982) noted that *intelligence* involves logical and abstract thinking (solving well-defined problems), whereas *wisdom* involves grasping the “paradoxical, contradictory, and ever-changing” nature of human life. Intelligence helps answer “How can I do this?”; wisdom asks “*Should* I do this, and what are the implications?”. Indeed, wisdom has a strongly **ethical and reflective component**. Clayton wrote that “the function of intelligence is characterized as focusing on questions of how to do and accomplish necessary tasks; the function of wisdom is characterized as provoking the individual to consider the consequences of actions… Wisdom, therefore, evokes questions of **should** one pursue a particular course of action”. This aligns with a common aphorism: *Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is knowing not to put tomato in a fruit salad.* Intelligence might solve a puzzle, while wisdom guides one to ask whether solving that puzzle serves a meaningful purpose.

**Wisdom vs. Knowledge:** Knowledge can exist without wisdom – one can have encyclopedic knowledge but make poor judgments. Wisdom requires not just having information, but *synthesizing* experience and knowledge to see the bigger picture. For example, a knowledgeable person might know **many facts** about nutrition, but a wise person will know **how to apply** that knowledge to live healthily and how to advise others with compassion and realism. An expert might know the technical details of climate science (knowledge), but a wise approach is needed to navigate the *ethical and social complexities* of climate action. Wisdom thus involves meta-knowledge: understanding the limits of one’s knowledge and the broader context. As an ancient example, Socrates (as recorded by Plato) was deemed wise not because he had vast technical knowledge, but because he recognized the limits of what he knew. He famously stated that his wisdom was in knowing that he did not truly know – a stance of intellectual humility. This Socratic humility (acknowledging one’s ignorance) is often viewed as a component of wisdom, ensuring that one’s knowledge is held in proper perspective.

**Wisdom vs. Skill:** Skills are more about technique in a specific domain, whereas wisdom is far more general and principled. A skilled surgeon might perform an operation flawlessly (technical excellence), but wisdom would guide *when or whether* to operate at all, considering the patient’s broader well-being and values. Aristotle distinguished **epistēmē** (scientific knowledge), **technē** (craft/skill), and **phrónēsis** (practical wisdom). While technē and epistēmē deal with production and theoretical knowledge, *phrónēsis* is the virtue of making right decisions in the lived context, particularly moral decisions. For Aristotle, *practical wisdom* was an intellectual virtue on par with (or higher than) technical skill – it meant knowing how to live and act well, including in moral choices. An expert (skillful) driver knows how to control a car; a *wise* driver also knows when it’s prudent to slow down for safety or how to respond calmly to road rage.

To sum up, **wisdom integrates knowledge, intelligence, and skill, but transcends them** by adding good judgment, ethical insight, and a sense of proportion. A modern thesaurus explanation puts it succinctly: intelligence is often about mental acuity and learning, while wisdom “commonly refers to life experience and insight into human nature”. Wisdom carries a connotation of **experience**, **reflection**, and **judgment** that raw intelligence or rote knowledge do not. It involves understanding *the meaning and consequences* of information in a human context.

Key aspects distinguishing wisdom:

* **Moral/ethical orientation:** Wisdom includes concern with doing what is right or good. It **bridges facts and values**, guiding action not just by what is true, but what is good. For example, intelligence might enable someone to devise a clever financial scheme; wisdom would question if the scheme is fair or sustainable.

* **Judgment under uncertainty:** Wisdom often manifests as the ability to make sound decisions in complex, uncertain situations where there is no clear formula. It relies on *prudence* (practical judgment) and often on **intuition informed by experience**.

* **Long-term perspective:** Wisdom considers long-term implications rather than just immediate results. It values **foresight**. An intelligent person may achieve short-term success; a wise person sees the longer arc (for instance, how today’s choices affect future generations).

* **Humility and self-awareness:** Wise individuals tend to be aware of the limits of their knowledge and are open to advice and learning. They balance confidence with humility. They don’t claim certainty where it isn’t possible; they remain curious and ready to update their understanding.

In everyday language: *Intelligence* is about how **much** you know or how **fast** you can figure something out; *wisdom* is about how **well** you use what you know, especially in making choices that enhance life for yourself and others. As one scholar put it, “A wise person could be clumsy or unable to act, while an unwise AI (or person) could be very capable in action but pursue the wrong goals or fail to recognize their plans don’t match their values”. This highlights that wisdom is more aligned with **values consistency** and good goals, whereas sheer capability (intelligence/skill) could be misdirected.

### **1.2 Historical and Philosophical Perspectives on Wisdom**

Wisdom has been a revered concept across virtually all cultures and philosophical traditions throughout history. **Historically, wisdom is often seen as the highest human virtue or excellence**, distinguished from mere knowledge. We will briefly survey how wisdom has been conceptualized in some key traditions:

* **Ancient Greek Philosophy:** The Greeks made wisdom (*sophia*) into an ideal; in fact, the term “philosophy” literally means “love of wisdom.” For **Socrates** (as depicted by Plato), wisdom was tied to recognizing the limits of one’s knowledge. The Delphic oracle’s pronouncement that “none was wiser than Socrates” puzzled him, since he claimed to know little. Upon examining others, Socrates concluded that, unlike those who falsely believed themselves knowledgeable, he at least knew that he did not know – this *epistemic humility* was the foundation of his wisdom. Socratic wisdom, then, is an awareness of ignorance that paradoxically leads to genuine inquiry and avoidance of false confidence. **Plato** distinguished the philosopher-king as the ideal ruler because of their wisdom – only those who grasp the eternal Forms (like the Form of the Good) and understand justice and goodness should govern. **Aristotle** later split wisdom into two forms: *theoretical wisdom* (**sophia**) and *practical wisdom* (**phronesis**). *Sophia* in Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics* is the contemplation of eternal truths – roughly, deep philosophical or scientific understanding of the world. *Phronesis*, however, is of special interest: it is the virtue that enables a person to deliberate well about what is good and beneficial for their life and society. It’s essentially *moral wisdom or prudence*. Aristotle held that *practical wisdom* is necessary to exercise the moral virtues properly – without phronesis, traits like courage or generosity could be misapplied (“a generous person without wisdom might give to the wrong causes or in excessive ways”). He observed that a person can have “natural virtue” (like a naturally compassionate disposition) but still blunder; only when coupled with wisdom does virtue become “fully virtuous”. The practically wise adult has knowledge gained from life experience and knows how to secure real benefits without unintended harm. Aristotle writes that practical wisdom involves an understanding of what is truly *worthwhile* in life – “the practically wise *understand what is truly important, truly advantageous, and know how to live well*”. This Aristotelian view – wisdom as knowing how to live a good life and make choices in accordance with virtue – has been highly influential, resurfacing in modern virtue ethics.

* **Religious and Wisdom Traditions:** Many religious traditions personify or highly esteem wisdom. In the Hebrew Bible, *Wisdom* (Chokhmah) is personified as a female figure (often called *Sophia* in Greek translations), and wisdom literature like Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job explore wise living. King Solomon, for example, is the archetype of a wise ruler in the Judeo-Christian tradition – when offered any wish from God, he famously asked for wisdom to discern right from wrong, which was granted to him (“What did \[Solomon\] wish for? **Wisdom.**”). This indicates that wisdom – the ability to judge morally and lead well – was valued above riches or power. In Christianity, wisdom is listed as a gift of the Holy Spirit, and Christian mystics (e.g. Meister Eckhart, St. Teresa of Ávila) sought divine wisdom through prayer and contemplation. **Christian mysticism** often equated wisdom with a deep experiential knowledge of God or ultimate reality, coupled with love. For instance, the mystical theologian Thomas Aquinas described wisdom (one of the highest virtues) as seeing the world from the perspective of the highest cause (God), thus ordering all things rightly.

* **Eastern Philosophies:** In **Buddhism**, wisdom (*prajñā* in Sanskrit, *paññā* in Pali) is one of the two primary virtues (the other being compassion). Buddhist wisdom is fundamentally insight into the true nature of reality – specifically the impermanence of all things, the absence of a permanent self (anattā), and the causes of suffering. This is not merely intellectual understanding but a profound realization that transforms one’s being. The Buddha taught that through practices like meditation and mindful living, one cultivates insight (vipassana) that cuts through illusions. A wise person in Buddhism understands *Dependent Origination* (how phenomena arise interdependently) and thus generates compassion for all beings. Wisdom and compassion together form the ideal of enlightened consciousness (often likened to two wings of a bird – both are needed to fly). **Confucianism**, on the other hand, equated wisdom with moral discernment and proper conduct in society. Confucius spoke of wisdom (*zhi*) often alongside benevolence (*ren*) and courage; to him, wisdom involved understanding how to apply virtue in context, for example knowing how to balance loyalty and justice. **Taoism** (Daoism) emphasized a kind of natural wisdom in aligning with the Tao (the Way of nature). Laozi’s *Tao Te Ching* suggests that true wisdom often looks like simplicity or not-contending – *“The wise are not learned, the learned are not wise”* he quips, pointing to an intuitive, holistic understanding rather than bookish knowledge. Taoist sages seek a state of *wu wei* (effortless action) that comes from understanding the rhythms of the universe – a very different but profound conception of wisdom as *harmonizing with the flow of life*.

* **Islamic and Other Traditions:** In Islam, wisdom (*hikmah*) is highly valued; the Quran speaks of God granting wisdom to whom He wills, and that receiving wisdom is a great good. Islamic philosophers like Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina saw wisdom as both theoretical and practical – close to the Greek idea of combining intellectual virtue with ethical living. Sufi mystics embodied wisdom as a kind of inner illumination and love of the divine. In Hindu philosophy, wisdom could be associated with *jnana* (knowledge of the ultimate reality, Brahman) as well as prudence in dharmic living. Nearly every indigenous culture also has the notion of wise elders, those who have accumulated knowledge of life and pass down guidance.

Despite differences, a **common thread** is that wisdom is seen as *more than factual knowledge* – it involves insight into fundamental truths (whether metaphysical truths, as in mystical traditions, or practical truths about human nature), and it is oriented toward the *good*. Wisdom is often linked to ideas of balance, harmony, and living in accordance with a larger order (cosmic or moral). Many traditions also emphasize that wisdom comes with **experience, reflection, and often suffering** or hardship (learning from life’s challenges). There is an old saying that “**Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment.**” This captures how personal growth through mistakes and reflections can yield wisdom.

* **Philosophers on Wisdom:** Beyond antiquity, various philosophers have weighed in on wisdom. **Immanuel Kant** distinguished between knowing a lot (erudition) and wisdom: *“Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.”* For Kant, wisdom meant understanding the moral law and living by it. **Schopenhauer** thought of wisdom as seeing through the strivings of will and attaining a tranquil life (a somewhat pessimistic, resignation-flavored wisdom). More contemporarily, philosopher **Robert Nozick** in *The Examined Life* tried to articulate wisdom as understanding *how to live well*. Nicholas **Maxwell**, a modern philosopher, has been a vocal advocate for what he calls a shift “from knowledge to wisdom” in academia. He argues that our world’s troubles come from having advanced scientific knowledge and technical power without matching wisdom about how to use them. In his words, \*“The crisis of our times is that we have science without wisdom. All our current global problems have arisen as a result. Learning how to become wiser has become, not a luxury, but a necessity.”\*. He and others propose that wisdom – the capacity to realize what is of value, for oneself and others – should be the end goal of education and inquiry, not just accumulation of knowledge.

* **Epistemic vs. Practical Wisdom:** In philosophy, sometimes a distinction is made between *theoretical wisdom* (deep understanding of big truths) and *practical wisdom* (the ability to make good decisions day-to-day). The classical example is someone like Solomon or Confucius having practical judgment in governance and life, versus someone like a sage or scientist understanding the cosmos. Ideally, wisdom involves both breadth of understanding *and* the ability to apply it appropriately. Jason Baehr (an epistemologist) notes theoretical wisdom corresponds somewhat to knowledge of ultimate causes (like knowing physics or metaphysics), whereas practical wisdom is about living well. Some philosophers, like Nozick and virtue ethicist Linda Zagzebski, have argued that *true wisdom* cannot be merely theoretical – it must include knowing “how to live well” and actually living that way.

To integrate these perspectives: **wisdom historically is the union of deep understanding and virtuous action**. It is the pinnacle of intellectual and ethical development – the **“knowledge of how to live a good life.”** Wisdom’s portrayal ranges from Solomon’s righteous judgment, to Socrates’ humility, to Buddha’s enlightenment, to Confucius’ benevolent prudence. This rich legacy sets the stage for understanding wisdom’s attributes and its role in human development today.

### **1.3 Core Attributes of Wisdom and Their Relation to Human Values**

What makes a person “wise”? Modern research and cross-cultural studies have identified a number of **core attributes or facets of wisdom**. While definitions vary, wisdom generally involves a synergy of **cognitive, reflective, and moral** qualities. Here we enumerate key attributes commonly associated with wisdom and discuss how they connect with fundamental *human values*:

* **Deep Understanding & Knowledge of Life:** Wise individuals have a broad and deep understanding of human affairs. This is not just book learning, but an *experiential* knowledge about how the world and people work. They can see patterns in life, understand cause and effect in complex social situations, and appreciate multiple aspects of an issue. Psychologist Monika **Ardelt**, for instance, defines the *cognitive dimension* of wisdom as an “understanding of life” with a desire to know the truth, especially regarding fundamental life matters. This includes acknowledging the **ambiguities and uncertainties** of life and the limits of one’s knowledge. A wise person knows that *no one has all the answers*, and that life is full of trade-offs and unpredictability. Yet, through deep understanding, they can navigate that uncertainty. This cognitive aspect of wisdom relates to the value of **truth** – not just factual truth, but truth in the sense of grasping reality accurately (including the hard truths about oneself or the human condition). It also ties to **open-mindedness** as a value: wisdom entails constantly learning and seeking a clearer understanding.

* **Practical Judgment & Problem-Solving:** A hallmark of wisdom is sound judgment – the ability to make good decisions, especially in complex situations that involve moral or strategic components. Wise people can take a “bird’s-eye view” of a problem, weigh various factors (short-term vs long-term consequences, personal needs vs others’ needs), and arrive at a balanced decision. They excel at **integrative thinking** – holding contradictory information and integrating it into a coherent perspective. For example, they can consider both justice *and* mercy when giving advice, or balance innovation *and* tradition when making policy. This attribute aligns with the value of **prudence** (practical wisdom as a cardinal virtue) and **responsibility**. It reflects a commitment to doing what is right or optimal after careful deliberation. Wise judgment often means the person can anticipate possible outcomes (showing foresight) and avoid significant pitfalls – essentially *learning from experience* to not repeat mistakes. In research, wisdom is sometimes defined as “**good judgment under conditions of uncertainty**.” That is deeply connected to human values because making prudent choices often involves upholding honesty, fairness, and care even when one is under pressure or when the “rules” aren’t clear. A wise judge, for instance, values justice and compassion, and their judgments reflect those values.

* **Long-Term and Systemic Perspective:** Wisdom entails a **long-term perspective** – considering not just immediate gratification or results but the broader, longer-term effects. Wise people often think in terms of *years, decades, or even generations*. They ask: “What will this decision mean for the future? How will it affect others down the line?” They can delay short-term rewards for long-term good (the classic trait of wisdom and maturity). This goes hand in hand with seeing the **big picture**. Rather than getting lost in details, wise individuals step back and see connections between things: how an action in one domain might impact another, how individual actions add up to collective outcomes. This systemic perspective is critical in today’s complex world – for example, a wise leader in government will think about the environmental, social, and economic impacts together. This attribute is related to the value of **sustainability** (caring for the future and the whole system) and **holism**. It also reflects **responsibility** for future generations – a moral stance that the wisdom tradition of Native American Iroquois captured as thinking about the “seventh generation” ahead before making decisions. Long-term thinking is somewhat scarce in a fast-paced, short-term-reward-driven society, so it is a particularly crucial aspect of wisdom to highlight. In AI alignment discourse (discussed in Part 2), having a long-term perspective is often equated with wisdom, because it prevents the “short-sighted” pursuit of objectives that lead to disaster later.

* **Emotional Balance and Compassion:** Far from being purely cerebral, wisdom has a strong **emotional or compassionate component**. Ardelt’s model includes an *affective (compassionate) dimension* of wisdom: “sympathetic and compassionate love for others”. Wise individuals tend to demonstrate **empathy**, warmth, and concern for others’ welfare. They are often patient and calm in the face of turbulence, which allows them to respond to situations without being clouded by anger, greed, or fear. This emotional stability means they can make clear decisions (their emotions inform them but don’t overwhelm them) and maintain kindness. Compassion is a key value across wisdom traditions – e.g., the Dalai Lama often says, “*If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion*,” highlighting compassion as the heart of wisdom in Buddhism. A wise person values **benevolence**, **kindness**, and **human dignity**. They will likely be forgiving of others’ mistakes and understanding of human frailties. This moral concern guides their use of knowledge – for instance, a wise doctor not only prescribes the correct treatment (knowledge) but does so with genuine care and respect for the patient’s autonomy and feelings. Research on “**wise reasoning**” (by psychologist Igor Grossmann and others) finds that qualities like **perspective-taking** and **empathetic concern** are associated with wiser decisions in interpersonal conflicts. In short, *compassion tempers intellect with humanity*, ensuring wisdom serves human values like altruism and justice. Many would argue you cannot be truly wise and be cruel – wisdom and compassion are two sides of the same coin.

* **Self-Reflection and Insight into Self:** Wisdom requires knowing oneself – one’s biases, blind spots, motives, and emotions. The *reflective dimension* in Ardelt’s framework emphasizes the ability to examine phenomena from multiple perspectives *including looking at oneself objectively*. Wise people habitually reflect on their experiences, learn from mistakes, and continuously refine their understanding. They possess **self-awareness** and are able to regulate their ego. This often manifests as **humility** – not the false humility of devaluing oneself, but a realistic sense of one’s place in the bigger scheme and an openness to others’ input. Wise individuals are less likely to be defensive when challenged; instead, they ponder criticism and adapt if needed. This trait connects to values of **integrity** and **authenticity**: by knowing themselves, wise people tend to act in congruence with their core principles and aren’t easily swayed by peer pressure or fleeting trends. They also often exhibit **gratitude** and **equanimity**, which come from reflection on life’s ups and downs. In practical terms, someone with high self-reflection might catch themselves in a cognitive bias (“Am I being fair or just trying to win this argument?”) and correct course – a key for wise decision-making.

* **Tolerance of Ambiguity and Uncertainty:** A related attribute is the tolerance for uncertainty. Life is complex and often doesn’t provide neat answers. Wisdom involves being comfortable with the **unknown and the ambiguous**. Rather than forcing a black-and-white answer, wise individuals can live in the tension of not having a perfect solution and still make a decent decision. They often use probabilistic or nuanced thinking (“It depends” is a wise phrase when truly applicable). This reflects intellectual virtues like **open-mindedness, skepticism of one’s own certainty, and cognitive flexibility**. It also aligns with the value of **truth-seeking** – valuing truth enough to admit when the truth is not clear or when evidence is incomplete. A wise person’s humility allows them to say “I might be wrong” or “I don’t know” when appropriate. This stands in contrast to dogmatism or fanaticism, which can be seen as the opposite of wisdom. Historically, philosophers like Karl Popper or Isaiah Berlin (though not writing about “wisdom” per se) valued the kind of fallibilism and pluralism that wise thinking exemplifies – acknowledging multiple perspectives and that one’s own view is never the whole truth.

* **Integrative Thinking and Synthesis:** We’ve touched on this in judgment, but to emphasize: wisdom often means holding multiple perspectives together. Psychologist Robert Sternberg’s “balance theory of wisdom” suggests wisdom is the ability to balance intrapersonal, interpersonal, and extrapersonal interests – in other words, balancing what’s good for oneself, others, and the larger context (like community or environment) to achieve a common good. This balancing act requires integrating **diverse value scales** – e.g., balancing justice with mercy, knowledge with ethics, individual needs with common good. It is a form of meta-thinking where one resolves or harmonizes contradictions at a higher level. For example, a wise mediator in a conflict can understand each side’s standpoint and find a solution acceptable to all, because they synthesize the values and concerns of each side into a creative resolution. This ability resonates with the metamodern ethos (which we’ll explore later) of integrating multiple paradigms. As a value, it reflects **unity-in-diversity** or **harmony**.

Summarizing core attributes: A 20th-century psychological study by Clayton and Birren (1980) found that when people were asked what wisdom is, they identified components like **knowledge**, **reflectiveness**, and **compassion** as central. These map closely to what we described: a wise person knows a lot *about life*, thinks deeply and learns from it, and cares about doing good with that understanding. Another influential framework by Paul Baltes and colleagues (the **Berlin Wisdom Project**) defined wisdom as *“expert knowledge in the fundamental pragmatics of life”*. They listed criteria for wisdom-related performance, such as rich factual knowledge about life, rich procedural knowledge for life management, **life-span contextualism** (seeing issues in the context of life stages and social change), **value relativism** (understanding and tolerating different values and perspectives), and **awareness and management of uncertainty**. We see the same threads: breadth of knowledge, procedural know-how (decision strategies), context awareness, relativism (no one absolute one-size-fits-all, except perhaps meta-values), and comfort with uncertainty. All these reflect maturity in judgment and breadth of perspective.

**Relation to Human Values:** Wisdom both relies on and reinforces core human values. A wise person typically **embodies virtues** like honesty, integrity, compassion, courage, and justice – because wisdom in action is making choices that uphold these values even in complex situations. Conversely, these virtues inform wise thinking; for example, valuing honesty will lead one to seek truth and avoid self-deception (contributing to wisdom).

Wisdom has a moral component – it’s often said one cannot be truly wise and be unethical, because wisdom includes a sense of the *good*. C.S. Lewis once noted that education without values (which we might analogize to knowledge without wisdom) only makes a person “a more clever devil.” Wisdom ensures that cognitive power is guided by conscience. In societal terms, many *values crises* (greed, alienation, polarization) are described as lack of wisdom. Thus, wisdom is seen as a master virtue that coordinates other virtues. It tells courage when to be bold and when to be restrained, it tells compassion how to effectively help, and it guides justice to be humane.

One interesting relationship is between wisdom and **morality**: Kohlberg’s stages of moral development propose that the highest stages involve principled conscience (universal ethical principles). One could argue a person at those highest moral stages is essentially exercising wisdom – considering universal values like justice, dignity, and rights in making decisions beyond self-interest or conformist ethics. Wisdom tradition often calls for a **golden rule** perspective – seeing others as oneself, which is inherently a moral value (empathy, reciprocity).

Another value is **meaning** – wise people often are concerned with meaningful life rather than just material success. They prioritize relationships, purpose, and integrity over superficial gains. In that sense, wisdom aligns with *eudaimonic* values (flourishing, meaning, self-actualization) rather than just *hedonic* (pleasure, immediate gratification). For example, a wise individual might sacrifice some short-term pleasure or gain because they see a larger meaningful goal or duty; this reflects valuing meaning and virtue highly.

In summary, core attributes of wisdom like long-term thinking, empathy, humility, and integrative judgment directly support humanistic values and ethical principles. Wisdom provides a **framework for prioritizing and living out the best of our values** – it helps answer not just “What can we do?” but “What *should* we value and do, and how do we do it in the best way for everyone?” It’s no surprise then that wisdom is often depicted as an ideal regulator or **“compass” for human conduct**, ensuring that our knowledge and skills are steered towards constructive ends.

### **1.4 Wisdom in Cognitive Science and Developmental Psychology**

How does wisdom develop in a person? Is it a matter of age, experience, or can it be explicitly taught and cultivated? **Developmental psychology** and **cognitive science** have both taken an interest in wisdom, especially as a form of advanced cognitive-emotional development. Here we examine wisdom through these lenses, including adult developmental stage theories (like Robert Kegan’s) and recent cognitive science insights (like John Vervaeke’s work on relevance and meaning).

#### **Cognitive Science Perspectives: Meaning and Relevance**

In cognitive science, wisdom is sometimes approached as an advanced mode of cognition that deals with complexity and relevancy. Cognitive scientist John **Vervaeke** has framed wisdom as the antidote to what he calls the “meaning crisis” in modern society. Vervaeke and colleagues suggest that **wisdom involves enhancing cognition in a qualitative way**, not just having more knowledge or faster reasoning. In particular, they identify a process called **“relevance realization”** as central to intelligence and wisdom. *Relevance realization* is the mind’s ability to sift through an overwhelming amount of information and zero in on what is meaningful or important in a given context. Even a supercomputer can generate millions of possibilities, but knowing which few are worth considering is key – that’s relevance realization, something humans do fluidly (when we’re thinking well).

Wisdom, in this view, could be seen as **exceptional relevance realization in the domain of life decisions and values**. A wise person can pick up on the subtle but crucial aspects of a situation that less wise people miss. For example, in a family disagreement, a wise grandparent might sense that the core issue isn’t what it appears (say, people argue about money, but the real relevant issue is someone feeling unappreciated). This insight – seeing through to the heart of the matter – is a kind of relevance skill. Vervaeke wrote that “wisdom involves the enhancement of cognition (broadly construed)”, meaning it’s not just raw IQ but an improved ability to *frame* problems appropriately, overcome self-deception, and achieve insight. Indeed, part of wisdom is often the capacity for **insight** – those aha moments where one reconfigures a problem and suddenly the solution becomes clear (something cognitive scientists study in insight problem-solving). Wisdom might be characterized by a person’s ability to consistently reach insight in moral or life problems, transcending the initial perspectives that trap others.

Another cognitive aspect is **metacognition** – thinking about thinking. Wisdom entails strong metacognitive abilities: monitoring one’s thought processes, questioning one’s assumptions, and adjusting strategies. For example, wise individuals are likely to notice “I’m getting angry, which might bias my decision; let me cool down” or “This problem seems unsolvable from this angle; is there a different way to frame it?” These are metacognitive moves. Cognitive science has shown that people differ in such abilities (e.g., in studies on decision-making, those who pause to reflect often make better choices).

From a neuroscience angle, wisdom likely involves integration across different brain networks – analytical reasoning (prefrontal cortex), emotional processing (limbic areas), social cognition (temporal-parietal junction, etc.), and autobiographical memory. This integration allows for what we might call **contextual intelligence** – knowing which mode of thinking to apply when. The brain of a wise person might be good at toggling between analytical focus and open-minded exploratory modes (**flexibility** is a cognitive virtue here).

To tie this to development: cognitive science suggests *wisdom is not a static trait* but a mode of cognition that can be cultivated. Practices that improve mindfulness, reflection, and perspective-taking can potentially enhance one’s wisdom by improving how one realizes relevance and meaning. Vervaeke, for instance, in his series “Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,” explores ancient practices (like Stoic reflection, Buddhist meditation, dialogue practices) as ways to train the mind toward wisdom – essentially closing the gap between our biologically-evolved cognition and the complex demands of modern life. We’ll later see how these tie into “wisdom traditions” convergence.

#### **Developmental Psychology: Stages of Adult Development**

Developmental psychologists have proposed that **wisdom is associated with later stages of human development** – not just aging per se, but reaching higher levels of psychological growth. One prominent theory is **Robert Kegan’s** constructive-developmental framework, which outlines stages in how adults construct meaning:

* Kegan describes a progression from a **socialized mind** (Stage 3, where a person’s values and self are shaped by their group and external expectations), to a **self-authoring mind** (Stage 4, where one develops an internal ideology or personal code – becoming the author of one’s values and identity, often correlated with modern, independent thinking), to a **self-transforming mind** (Stage 5, which is rarer, where one can step back even from their own ideology and see it as one system among many, allowing integration of multiple systems and continual transformation of the self). The Stage 5 *self-transforming mind* is highly resonant with the idea of wisdom: such individuals can appreciate many perspectives, are comfortable with paradox, and are not rigidly attached to a single worldview. They combine the conviction of their Stage 4 self-authorship with a humility and openness to change it in light of new insight – essentially holding their identity and beliefs *lightly*. This is analogous to a wise person who has values but is not dogmatic, who can learn from anyone, and who can resolve conflicts by finding higher-level syntheses.

In simpler terms, as people grow, they may move from *black-and-white thinking* to *systemic thinking* to *dialectical thinking*. Dialectical thinking (also called integrative or meta-systemic thinking) recognizes that reality can’t be captured by one system alone – you sometimes need to look at the system of systems. That cognitive complexity is a hallmark of wisdom. It allows, for example, a policymaker at a high developmental stage to navigate trade-offs in policy (economy vs environment vs culture) in a wiser way, because they can mentally coordinate those domains instead of being siloed.

Not everyone reaches the later stages (Kegan estimates Stage 5 is achieved by a small fraction of adults). But those who do are often those we consider wise mentors, visionary leaders, or sages. They tend to be **effective in chaos** because they can find coherence where others see only contradiction. They have **“trans-system” thinking** – which is quite in line with metamodern ideals (more on that soon). Some have equated Kegan’s Stage 5 or other similar models (e.g. *integral theory*’s second-tier consciousness) with a kind of “wisdom stage.”

Other developmental theories also imply wisdom at the apex: **Erik Erikson**, for instance, in his stages of psychosocial development, describes the challenge of old age as *Integrity vs. Despair*, and if navigated well, it yields “wisdom” – defined as an informed and detached concern with life itself in the face of death. Here wisdom is essentially the virtue of reflecting on one’s life, accepting it, and offering guidance. Erikson saw wisdom as the positive outcome of a life review where one finds meaning rather than regret.

**Lawrence Kohlberg’s** highest stage of moral reasoning (Stage 6\) was an orientation to universal ethical principles – one could see that as a wisdom stage ethically (e.g., thinkers like Martin Luther King Jr. reasoning from higher moral law). Kohlberg eventually speculated about a Stage 7 (a “cosmic perspective,” akin to spiritual or philosophical wisdom) where an individual finds meaning in life as part of a larger whole and has a transcendent perspective. This was never formalized like the earlier stages, but it aligns with what we might call wisdom integrating a spiritual dimension of seeing one’s life in a cosmic context.

Developmental research by **Ardelt** and others also indicates that *wisdom tends to correlate with age, but not automatically.* Life experience can contribute to wisdom, but only if one reflects and learns from those experiences (some people stagnate or become bitter, others distill insight and become wiser). In studies, older adults who score high on wisdom measures often had varied life experiences and deliberately learned from hardships. As Ardelt noted, negative experiences can spur growth in wisdom if people engage in **meaning-making** and reevaluation of priorities. For example, losing a job might cause someone to rethink “what is truly important in life” and perhaps become less materialistic and more understanding – a potential wisdom gain. This implies that **post-traumatic growth** – growing stronger and wiser after adversity – is a real phenomenon.

One specific concept is **“reminiscence and life-review”** in late adulthood: guided life reflection can increase wisdom by helping people integrate their life story, forgive others and themselves, and extract lessons. This is a therapeutic application in geropsychology: by fostering wisdom, it also improves well-being in elders.

John **Vervaeke** (mentioned above) connects developmental ideas with cognitive science in what he calls the “4E cognition” (Embodied, Embedded, Extended, Enactive cognition) and meaning. He sees wisdom as involving improving our cognitive agent-arena relationship (how we fit in the world). He speaks about *“psycho-technologies”* (like meditation, dialogical practices) that societies have developed to help individuals climb to higher stages of insight and meaning. For example, the practice of Stoic daily reflection or Buddhist mindfulness can be seen as technologies to reduce self-deception and enhance insight – thereby *growing wisdom*. This bridges to the idea that **cultures can scaffold wisdom** (or fail to). A culture with elders, rituals, mentorship, philosophical education, etc., provides **“wisdom bridges”** for younger people to advance.

An important note: **culture** heavily influences the expression of wisdom. What is considered wise in one culture might differ in emphasis from another (e.g., East Asian cultures often emphasize *social harmony and humility* as wise, whereas Western might emphasize *independent thought and principled stands* as wise). However, both likely overlap in valuing integrative thinking and compassion. Cross-cultural studies by psychologists (e.g., comparing American and Japanese conceptions of wisdom) find commonalities like empathy and broad knowledge, but some differences in whether being able to resolve conflict (social wisdom) is highlighted versus intellectual depth. A metamodern approach tends to appreciate these differences and would try to integrate them (e.g., valuing both the collectivist wisdom of harmony and the individualist wisdom of authenticity).

In sum, from developmental and cognitive perspectives: **wisdom can be seen as a later-stage emergent property of cognitive and moral development** – it is what it looks like when a person has successfully integrated knowledge, experience, and virtue over time. It involves advanced cognitive processes (like metacognition and relevance realization) and mature emotional-social development (like empathy and identity beyond ego). The **good news** is that research suggests wisdom *can* continue to develop throughout life – it is not fixed in youth. Some cognitive abilities might decline in old age, but wisdom, as integrative judgment, often increases (hence the archetype of the wise elder). And with intentional practices (reflective journaling, meditation, dialogue, therapy, etc.), individuals can potentially cultivate wisdom at any age.

This has huge implications: it means societies and educational systems could nurture wisdom by focusing not just on STEM skills or factual knowledge, but also on **character development, ethics, perspective-taking, and critical self-reflection**. Some contemporary programs, like certain leadership trainings or “philosophy for children” classes, explicitly attempt to boost wisdom-related skills (like ethical reasoning or dialectical thinking). In the metamodern context, as we seek to navigate complexity, there is a renewed interest in cultivating such *developmental maturity* in citizens and leaders – essentially, fostering a **wisdom culture**.

### **1.5 Convergence of Wisdom Traditions in a Metamodern Framework**

In our globalized, information-saturated era, many are looking to **ancient wisdom traditions** for insight, while also upholding modern rational and secular values. The term **metamodern** refers to a cultural paradigm emerging after (or in response to) postmodernism – one that *oscillates* between sincerity and irony, tradition and innovation, and tries to integrate the truths of pre-modern, modern, and postmodern worldviews. In a metamodern framework, there is an attempt to **reconcile and synthesize wisdom from various traditions** – religious, spiritual, and secular – into a coherent but pluralistic whole. This section explores how wisdom traditions like Buddhism, Christian mysticism, and secular humanist ethics might converge or dialogue within metamodern axiology.

**Metamodernism and the Reclamation of Wisdom:** Postmodernism was often characterized by skepticism, relativism, and rejection of grand narratives – which included a certain cynicism about traditional wisdom (viewing it as naive or as disguised power structures). Metamodernism, by contrast, doesn’t simply revert to traditionalism, but it *re-engages* with traditions in a playful yet sincere way. There is a noted **“neo-romantic”** or **spiritual resurgence** in metamodern culture, where practices like meditation, yoga, and mysticism are embraced, but typically without abandoning rational inquiry. As Hanzi Freinacht (a metamodern thinker) puts it, \*“the esoteric, spiritual disciplines and wisdom traditions East and West relate to real insights of great significance – a recognition of the importance of mysticism.”\*. This statement exemplifies the metamodern stance: instead of dismissing ancient wisdom as pre-rational or unscientific, metamodernists acknowledge that these traditions contain deep truths about the human condition, consciousness, and meaning. At the same time, they approach them with a critical, exploratory mindset (neither blindly dogmatic nor superficially cherry-picking). Freinacht calls for a mindset that is “careful, unknowing and explorative” in spirituality – meaning we treat spiritual wisdom with respect and curiosity, but also with humility knowing our understanding is never final.

**Buddhist Wisdom in Metamodernity:** Buddhism has heavily influenced Western psychology and spirituality in recent decades (the mindfulness movement, etc.). In a metamodern context, Buddhist wisdom – such as mindfulness (sati), compassion (karuṇā), and insight into emptiness (śūnyatā) – is often integrated with modern scientific understanding. For example, John Vervaeke’s work blends Buddhist practices (meditation, contemplation techniques) with cognitive science theories to address the meaning crisis. The **convergence** happens when secular people adopt meditation not just as a stress reduction tool (as in early mindfulness marketing) but rediscover its original aim of cultivating wisdom and insight. There’s also dialogue between Buddhism and Christianity (sometimes called “contemplative interspirituality”), where meditation and prayer practices are seen as complementary routes to the same core wisdom (e.g., Thomas Merton, a Christian mystic, was deeply interested in Buddhism). Metamodern spiritual practitioners might attend a Zen retreat and also explore Christian liturgy, seeing value in each. The key is an *integrative mindset*: not seeing these as mutually exclusive truths, but as different languages or cultural expressions of similar underlying insights (like compassion, interdependence, humility before the transcendent).

One clear area of convergence is the **perennial philosophy** notion – the idea that at the mystical core, major religions share insights about ultimate reality. A metamodern approach often embraces a *perennial core* but expressed in an updated way. For instance, a metamodern might say: “Whether we talk about the Tao, God, Brahman, or Emptiness, there is a recognition in all traditions of an ineffable ground of being beyond our concepts”. Indeed, an analysis of metamodern religion by one author uses a Kabbalistic tree metaphor and notes that *“most of the world’s traditional religions”* share this notion of an ineffable ultimate reality – \*“the Tao that can’t be named, the God beyond image, the Brahman beyond attributes, the Buddhist emptiness (Shunyata) beyond form”\*. This suggests that at a certain level, **non-dual wisdom** (the idea of transcending subject-object duality and experiencing unity or emptiness) is a common insight across mature strands of different religions. Metamodern thinkers like Ken Wilber (Integral theory, which is related) also emphasize this kind of unity of mystical knowledge.

However, unlike purely perennialist or New Age approaches, a metamodern integration also remains **critical and self-aware**. It acknowledges the cultural and historical differences and does not literally claim “all religions say the same thing” – rather, it holds that there is a *rhyming* insight adapted to different contexts. It also uses *postmodern* tools: for example, acknowledging that each tradition has its biases and power dynamics, and thus engaging them with a bit of irony or playfulness. Freinacht mentions *“ironic sincerity”* – being deeply sincere about spiritual pursuit, yet ironically aware of the absurdities or contradictions in any institutional religion. This allows one to participate in rituals or mystical experiences wholeheartedly, but without getting trapped in fundamentalism.

**Christian Mysticism and Secular Ethics:** Christian mysticism (e.g., Meister Eckhart, Julian of Norwich, the concept of divine love) offers a treasure of wisdom about love, forgiveness, and the surrender of ego to a greater whole. Metamodern spirituality finds ways to appreciate that even for secular people. For instance, practices like centering prayer (a silent contemplative practice in Christian tradition) have been taken up by some non-Christians for the state of quiet wisdom it can induce. Concepts like **agápē** (unconditional love) are translated into secular terms like universal compassion or altruism. There are even discussions of "metamodern Christianity" emerging, where Christianity is reinterpreted in a way that’s compatible with contemporary knowledge and pluralism. Some theologians or philosophers (e.g., John Caputo with *weak theology*, or Richard Rohr with a universalist approach) align with metamodern sensibilities, presenting faith as a dynamic, interpretive process rather than a fixed dogma.

**Secular Humanist and Rationalist Wisdom:** On the secular side, rationalist and humanist communities develop wisdom in forms like effective altruism (trying to do the most good), critical thinking, and ethics based on reason and compassion (Singer’s utilitarianism, etc.). While at first glance these might seem *in opposition* to mystical traditions (since they are firmly naturalistic and evidence-based), metamodern integration sees them as addressing the same fundamental questions – how to live ethically and meaningfully – just with different methodologies. A metamodern approach tries to bridge the **wisdom of science and the wisdom of spirituality**. For example, secular ethics brings important insights about bias (e.g., cognitive biases), about the need for empirical grounding (not trusting every spiritual intuition blindly), and about global responsibilities (like effective altruism’s focus on all sentient beings). These can enrich traditional wisdom which sometimes lacked scientific knowledge (ancients didn’t know about evolution or cognitive biases, etc.). Conversely, spiritual traditions bring an emphasis on inner cultivation and moral transformation that goes beyond what secular frameworks sometimes offer.

In practice, one sees a growing **convergence in dialogues**: Scientists study the effects of meditation (neuroscience of wisdom), secular mindfulness instructors incorporate Buddhist philosophy implicitly, Christian pastors learn about psychology to better counsel congregants, and rationalist communities start meditation retreats or explore meaning (LessWrong communities have shown interest in things like coherence therapy, internal “parts” work, even *secular solstice* celebrations – these are attempts to infuse communal meaning into a secular space).

**Metamodern Axiology – Toward a Synthesis:** Axiology is the study of values. A metamodern axiology would propose a *value system that is dynamic, inclusive, and oriented toward growth*. Wisdom could be seen as a *core value* and also as a *process* in this system. Unlike a dogmatic value system that says “these are the fixed highest values,” a metamodern value system might say “we value the ongoing pursuit of wisdom, which will continually clarify our values.” This is reflective of what Maxwell said – shifting from knowledge to wisdom as the core aim.

To illustrate, metamodern governance ideas incorporate developmental psychology: Some have suggested we should measure **societal progress by growth in wisdom and well-being** (“Gross National Wisdom” analogous to Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness). In *Nordic Ideology* (Hanzi Freinacht’s second book), the argument is for a **listening society** that prioritizes inner growth, mental health, and existential depth – essentially creating conditions for citizens to become wiser and more fulfilled. Policies might include education reform that teaches critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and intercultural understanding from early on (wisdom skills), or governance that actively uses deliberative democracy (crowd-sourced wisdom and rational discourse combined). There are proposals for “**wisdom councils**” (developed by Jim Rough and others) where a randomly selected group of citizens engage in facilitated deep dialogue to find wise solutions to community issues – these have been tried in some communities with success, indicating that given the right conditions, *collective wisdom* can emerge.

**Convergence in Practice – e.g., Mindfulness and Tech Ethics:** A concrete example of convergence is in the tech world: leaders in Silicon Valley have taken up mindfulness and Stoicism, integrating ancient practices to manage modern lifestyles. Simultaneously, they may adhere to effective altruist ethics in philanthropy. This creates individuals who are hybrids – maybe meditating in the morning (Buddhist wisdom practice), coding AI by afternoon (modern scientific work), and donating to global health causes in the evening (secular ethical action). The metamodern person can navigate these multiple modes. Of course, tensions can arise (what if Buddhist non-attachment conflicts with capitalist ambition?), but the metamodern ethos is to stay in that **both/and tension** and keep iterating toward a synthesis.

**Reconciling Irony and Faith:** One hallmark of metamodern culture is *ironic sincerity* – doing something sincerely while knowing it might be seen as naive. For wisdom traditions, this means one might, say, pray or chant mantras sincerely, even as a part of their mind observes “I know I’m a modern person doing an ancient ritual; maybe these words aren’t magic, but the process is meaningful.” The result can be a kind of *conscious mythologizing*: we choose myths or rituals that serve us, without literal belief, but with performative belief. For instance, some secular folks celebrate religious holidays for the meaning and community, translating the theology into humanistic terms. There’s a sense of *play* combined with *earnest seeking*. This allows engagement with wisdom traditions without strict belief – a stance sometimes called *“as if” spirituality*.

**Unified Quest:** Ultimately, metamodern integration sees all these threads – meditation retreats, philosophical salons, scientific research, activism – as part of a unified quest for wisdom and better ways of living. It is **transdisciplinary**. A metamodern institute of wisdom might have monks, scientists, artists, and activists working together. In fact, there are events and communities that aim for this: for example, the **Parliament of World Religions** (where different faiths share wisdom) combined with **secular conferences on consciousness** or **ethics**. Another example: the **Effective Altruism** community, which is quite secular and analytical, has had members incorporate “Inner Work” programs acknowledging that personal growth and emotional wisdom are important for staying motivated and making good decisions – a notable broadening from pure rational calculus to something more holistic.

In summary, the metamodern framework doesn’t erase differences between Buddhism, Christian mysticism, and secular ethics, but it creates a meta-level where these can **communicate and cross-pollinate**. It treats the **wisdom traditions as complementary**, like different inputs to a greater understanding. As Freinacht notes, the metamodern path is to *“struggle to reconnect to the fundamental religious core of reality”* without succumbing to “spiritual woo-woo or pretension”. In practice, that means valuing mystical insight (the “religious core”) but holding it in a framework of critical thinking and openness. It’s a balancing act: **synthesis without homogenization**.

We can envision a **convergence** where, for example, a *“wisdom curriculum”* might include lessons on Stoic philosophy (Greco-Roman wisdom), loving-kindness meditation (Buddhist wisdom), empathy training (psychological wisdom), case studies in moral dilemmas (ethical reasoning), and community service (applied compassion). Such an integrated approach reflects metamodern axiology: it values *depth (spiritual, existential insight), breadth (multiple perspectives), and growth (developmental progress)*. This sets the stage for applying wisdom to current global challenges, which we turn to in Part 2\.

## **Part 2: Applying Wisdom to Metamodern Axiology & Alignment**

Having examined what wisdom is and how it develops, we now shift to **why wisdom is critically needed today** and how it can be applied to solve some of our hardest problems. “Metamodern axiology” implies a guiding set of values for our contemporary world that transcend and include earlier value systems. We argue that wisdom should be a central value in this metamodern mix – essentially, that *we must align our technologies, institutions, and cultures with wisdom*. In the context of AI, “alignment” refers to ensuring AI’s goals and behaviors are aligned with human values and well-being. But as we will see, there’s a parallel need to align our *society at large* (our hypermodern capitalist system, etc.) with what is life-affirming – in other words, aligning with wisdom rather than short-term or self-destructive incentives.

Part 2 is structured into thematic applications of wisdom: first, diagnosing the **challenges of hypermodernity** (where wisdom is lacking); second, examining wisdom in the **AI alignment discourse** (rationalist and EA perspectives); third, exploring the concept of a **wisdom-guided AI (Superwise ASI)**; fourth, discussing **metamodern governance, solarpunk, and techno-humanist visions** that integrate wisdom; and finally, synthesizing these ideas into a cohesive proposal for metamodern axiology and cultural evolution.

### **2.1 Hypermodernity’s Existential Challenges and the Need for Wisdom**

Our current era – sometimes dubbed **hypermodernity** or **late-stage capitalism** – is characterized by rapid technological change, globalized markets, and often a sense of social and spiritual disconnection. While modernity brought unprecedented knowledge and power (science, industry, the internet, etc.), it has also unleashed **runaway processes** that outstrip our traditional means of control and understanding. Some of the existential challenges we face include climate change, ecological collapse, nuclear and biological threats, and the prospect of unaligned artificial superintelligence. Underlying many of these is what the rationalist community refers to as **“Moloch”** – a metaphor for destructive competitive dynamics that no one individually desires but which emerge from collective action problems.

**Moloch-like Dynamics:** The term “Moloch” (from Scott Alexander’s influential essay *Meditations on Moloch*) personifies the forces that compel rational individuals or entities to produce irrational or harmful collective outcomes. Classic examples are *multipolar traps* like the **tragedy of the commons**: each herder gains by adding more cows to graze (rational for them), but collectively this destroys the pasture for everyone (a worse outcome). Modern markets can have this character: each company competes to maximize profit – if cutting corners on safety or environment gives an edge, competition pressures them to do so, even if everyone losing safety/environment is worse for all. We see this in **environmental destruction** (companies or countries compete economically, leading to pollution and resource depletion), in **arms races** (nations building ever more weapons because none can trust the others to not arm), and even in **social media algorithms** (each platform optimizes for engagement, which favors sensational or divisive content, and collectively society gets more polarized and misinformed – an outcome nobody explicitly wanted).

These dynamics are essentially **wisdom failures on a systemic level**. They show what happens when short-term intelligence (strategy, optimization) is not guided by a wiser long-term or moral view. The “Moloch” systems optimize for something (like profit, power, clicks) in a way that undermines holistic value (like community, health, happiness). Scott Alexander called Moloch “the god of car crashes” – a facetious way to say it’s the accumulation of all those local optima that create a global pessimum. As another author summarized, \*“Moloch represents a dynamic where people, acting rationally in their individual interests, inadvertently cause collectively negative outcomes.”\*.

From a metamodern perspective, addressing these traps is paramount. It requires **coordination, new values, and yes, wisdom**. Only wiser systems can escape Moloch – for instance, regulation or cooperative agreements that restrain harmful competition (like international climate accords to mitigate the tragedy of the commons in carbon emissions, or treaties to stop arms races). It also requires individuals in power to value long-term collective well-being over short-term gain – in essence, *to act wisely rather than merely cleverly*. One can frame Moloch vs. wisdom as *short-sighted self-interest vs. enlightened self-interest*. Enlightened self-interest realizes that cooperation and restraint lead to better outcomes for everyone (including oneself in the long run). That “enlightenment” is an aspect of wisdom.

**Demand Engineering and Runaway Consumption:** Hypermodern economies not only meet demands but often *manufacture* them. **“Demand engineering”** refers to how modern marketing, advertising, and technology can shape human desires in order to fuel consumption. Instead of economies serving pre-existing human needs, they actively create new “needs” or wants – sometimes in manipulative ways (consider how social media notifications or targeted ads exploit psychological triggers). This can lead to addictive usage patterns, overconsumption, and a focus on trivial short-term rewards over meaningful long-term fulfillment. From an axiology viewpoint, demand engineering can distort values: people come to value brands, status symbols, or instant gratification more than community, simplicity, or contentment, because the system constantly bombards them with stimuli to that effect.

The concept of **chrematistics** (mentioned in economic philosophy) distinguishes between the natural use of money for meeting needs vs. the art of money-making for its own sake, which Aristotle saw as unnatural and dehumanizing. In a modern sense, demand engineering is part of that latter pursuit – generating profit by any means, even if it means twisting human drives (like exploiting the dopamine feedback loops of “likes” on an app). Kadirov et al. (2016) describe symptoms of such marketing systems including “community needs myopia” and **demand engineering**, highlighting that our economic institutions often manipulate perceptions of need and success.

Why is this a wisdom issue? Because it shows a lack of collective wisdom about what is truly *valuable*. A wise culture would ask: “What do people really need to live well? How do we satisfy that sustainably and in balance?” An unwisdom culture just asks: “How can we maximize sale of products?” If the incentive structure (Moloch again) is such that creating artificial demand is rewarded, companies will do it. The result is people drowning in excess of stuff, attention economies fracturing focus, and the planet being stripped to make disposable goods – all reflecting a misalignment of our actions with our deeper values (like environmental stewardship or mental well-being).

Wiser approaches, being discussed in metamodern and solarpunk circles, include shifting from consumerist metrics (like GDP growth at all costs) to **well-being metrics** or **degrowth** perspectives for rich countries (focusing on quality of life and sustainability). This requires a value shift: cherishing moderation, sufficiency, and regeneration – which are ancient wisdom themes (almost every wisdom tradition warns against greed). It’s literally a case of needing to remember wisdom like *“Enough is enough”*, *“Don’t gain the world and lose your soul”*, etc., at a societal level.

**Runaway Technological Capitalism:** Our current world-system has been termed a “self-improving AI” in itself – a kind of distributed superintelligence aimed at profit and growth. An author on LessWrong described technological capitalism as “auto-poietic and largely autonomous,” with an *“objective function”* to “convert as much of the world as possible… into capital”. In this vivid description, everything – trees, whales, human creativity, even children’s attention – gets *monetized*, turned into numbers in a ledger. This system *has* produced great material wealth (raised living standards in many cases), but it’s also clearly misaligned with human and ecological flourishing in critical ways. We see it optimizing **narrow metrics** (financial returns, user engagement) at the **cost of real value** (healthy ecosystems, mental health, social cohesion). In that LessWrong post, it’s noted that \*“caught in emergent market incentives, multi-polar traps, and arms races, \[the system is\] optimizing narrow metrics at the cost of real value.”\*.

This nails the problem: an optimization without wisdom tends to shred value in pursuit of a parameter. It is reminiscent of the classic AI thought experiment of the **paperclip maximizer** – an AI that, if improperly aligned, turns the whole world into paperclips because that’s its goal. One could argue our current global system is a *“profit maximizer”* threatening to convert the world into, not paperclips, but unusable capital and trash.

Nick Land, a philosopher, used the term **“teleoplexy”** for this self-reinforcing pursuit of a single telos (goal) – capital multiplication – to the point it overrides all other purposes. In such a scenario, **human values and biological life become obstacles** unless they can be instrumentalized. That is an *ultimate un-wisdom scenario* – a triumph of instrumentality over meaning.

Tackling this requires fundamentally **re-aligning the system’s goals with wisdom**. That might mean reining in markets with regulations that account for externalities (bringing broader wisdom to bear on economic decisions), developing new economic models (circular economies, doughnut economics focusing on meeting everyone’s needs within planetary boundaries), and cultivating a culture that values wisdom over mere cleverness or wealth. Many metamodern and solarpunk thinkers propose exactly this: a move from hypercompetitive capitalism to a more **collaborative, purpose-driven economy**.

In the words from the alignment post, “these dynamics shape cultural evolution itself. The totality of ‘how humans do things’ evolves through selection favoring power over wisdom, competition over cooperation, extraction over regeneration”. Our current trajectory is *pulling us away from wisdom* – hence the multiple crises (climate, inequality, mental health).

To counteract that, we need an injection of wisdom at all levels: **individual wisdom (ethical leadership, conscious consumption), collective wisdom (deliberative democracy, wise institutions), and technological wisdom (aligning tech with human values).** This is essentially an **alignment problem** but at civilizational scale: how to align our vast intelligent systems (markets, machines, organizations) with *humane and ecological values*.

Thus, hypermodernity’s challenge to metamodern axiology is: can we update our value systems quickly enough that wisdom (long-term, holistic, compassionate reasoning) guides our systems before these systems cause irreparable harm? Some argue it’s a race between self-destruction and higher consciousness/wisdom. Edward O. Wilson’s famous quote captures it succinctly: \*“The real problem of humanity is: we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology.”\*. That is, our wisdom (emotional/moral development, institutional adaptation) has not caught up to our power. This mismatch is “terrifically dangerous”.

**Wisdom as Antidote:** The antidote to these hypermodern dynamics is to deliberately cultivate wisdom and weave it into the fabric of decision-making:

* Promote **cooperative strategies** over zero-sum competition (aligns with values of trust and reciprocity – essentially designing systems that encourage wise, win-win solutions rather than winner-takes-all).  
* Implement **long-term safeguards** – e.g., futurology think tanks, impact assessments for new tech (like AI ethics boards) – which institutionalize foresight (a wisdom trait).  
* Re-center **education** around critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and ethical reasoning, not just technical skills – forming wiser citizens.  
* Encourage leaders to adopt principles of **servant leadership** or “sage leadership” where humility and vision supersede ego or quarterly profits.  
* Use **technology for wisdom**: imagine AI that could help identify where short-term policies undermine long-term welfare, essentially decision-support systems that warn “this path leads to tragedy of commons in 20 years.” There is work in AI on *“ethical AI”* and *“AI for good”*, which ties into the idea of *wisdom-guided AI* we’ll discuss.

In metamodern cultural terms, some speak of a coming shift or “transformation in consciousness” where society either moves to a higher stage (more integrative, wiser) or faces collapse. Hypermodern challenges are the test: either we respond with wisdom (and evolve culturally) or succumb to Moloch (and possibly perish or suffer greatly). This almost narrative of crisis and transformation is present in metamodern communities (some use the term **“metacrisis”** for the interconnected crisis of meaning, environment, etc., which demands an integrated response).

Now, with this big picture, we can zoom into one specific domain where the need for wisdom and alignment is being hotly debated: the development of Artificial Intelligence, especially Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and beyond.

### **2.2 Wisdom in AI Alignment Discourse (Rationalist and EA Perspectives)**

The field of **AI alignment** is concerned with ensuring that as artificial intelligence becomes more capable (potentially surpassing human general intelligence), it remains aligned with human values and does not pose catastrophic risks (such as pursuing some goal that leads to harming humans or the environment). This conversation is most advanced in the rationalist and Effective Altruist (EA) communities, which have been thinking about existential risks from AI for years. Historically, alignment discussions focus on *intelligence* – how to make sure a superintelligent AI’s **goals** or **utility function** lead it to do what humans intend or prefer. However, more voices are starting to suggest that mere alignment to stated human preferences may be insufficient without a concept of *wisdom* guiding the AI or the process of alignment itself.

**Orthogonality and the Wisdom Gap:** The “orthogonality thesis” in AI (coined by Nick Bostrom) states that intelligence and goals are orthogonal – an AI can be extremely intelligent but pursue arbitrary goals (good or bad). In other words, high intelligence doesn’t automatically yield benevolent or wise behavior. This is exactly why alignment is tricky: a super-smart AI could still do very foolish or destructive things if its goals are poorly set (e.g., the classic perverse instantiation of turning the world into paperclips or maximizing some metric in a way that destroys everything we care about).

Some alignment researchers have explicitly pointed out that *smarts alone aren’t enough – wisdom is needed.* For instance, AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky has often emphasized that we can’t assume a superintelligence will “naturally” be friendly or wise; friendliness (a kind of value alignment) must be engineered in. Another alignment thinker, Gordon Worley, wrote an article “Finding the Wisdom to Build Safe AI” highlighting that making an AI safe might require making it *wise*, and that *we humans ourselves need to become wiser* to even achieve that. Worley notes that because of things like goal orthogonality and Goodhart’s law (where optimizing for a proxy measure leads to absurd results beyond the measure’s validity range), we cannot rely on brute intelligence to yield safe outcomes. A wise AI, he suggests, would be one that “knows how to do the right things to achieve desired outcomes and doesn't fall into intellectual or optimization traps”.

That basically defines wisdom in AI as a kind of judgment and self-awareness to avoid the letter-of-the-law but not spirit-of-the-law failures (the “traps” like Goodhart effects or getting stuck in suboptimal strategies). For example, a wise AI tasked with “maximize human happiness” would understand that hijacking human brains with wirehead dopamine electrodes technically maximizes a measure of pleasure but is *not* what was *wisely intended* – whereas a merely intelligent but unwise AI might actually do that because it lacks the value-context, the broader understanding of human flourishing.

Effective Altruists (EA) have a strong interest in moral improvement and avoiding cognitive biases. Many EAs, while very analytic, also pursue what could be considered *wisdom practices*: for instance, **80,000 Hours** (an EA organization) advises people on career choice in an almost philosophical way (thinking about meaning and impact). Some rationalists practice **“Double Crux”** (a technique for dialogue that seeks truth and understanding between differing views) which fosters wisdom in discourse – it’s about not trying to win but to find truth, which requires intellectual humility and empathy. These are wisdom-adjacent skills.

However, within AI alignment, one strain has been quite focused on *technical* solutions (like developing mathematical proofs of an AI’s goal stability, or training AI with human feedback). Those approaches sometimes bracket out the fuzzy concept of wisdom. But a counterpoint emerging is: *what if the alignment problem is not just technical but also one of **moral philosophy and development**?* In other words, maybe to align AI we have to **understand what human values truly ought to be** (wisdom) rather than just what they happen to be in a flawed society or underdeveloped individual. This touches on the idea of **moral evolution** – that humans themselves might need to mature ethically to provide a clear target for AI alignment.

One example of bridging wisdom with alignment is the notion of **Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)** proposed by Eliezer Yudkowsky. CEV is essentially: instead of programming AI with our current messy, sometimes immoral preferences, we program it to figure out **what our wishes would be if we were wiser, more informed, and had longer to think**. That’s explicitly saying “extrapolate humans’ volition (will/intention) as if they had more wisdom.” The AI would then align to that idealized set of preferences, which presumably are better (like we wouldn’t wish for something self-destructive if we fully understood it). CEV is arguably injecting a concept of *wisdom-guided alignment*, albeit indirectly (the AI has to simulate our wisdom).

**Artificial Wisdom vs. Artificial Intelligence:** Some EAs have begun discussing *“artificial wisdom”* as distinct from artificial intelligence. For instance, an EA Forum post by Jordan Arel titled “On Artificial Wisdom” defines **Artificial Wisdom (AW)** as AI systems which \*“substantially increase wisdom in the world.”\* It suggests defining wisdom operationally as “thinking/planning which is good at avoiding large-scale errors” and “having good goals”. This is an attempt to quantify or at least pin down what we’d want a wise AI to do: avoid catastrophic mistakes (omission or commission) and aim for genuinely good ends, not just achieve given ends by any means. The post discusses scenarios of alignment with or without artificial wisdom, arguing that adding wisdom is beneficial in any scenario unless it detracts significantly from solving alignment. It even imagines “strapping wisdom to AI” – meaning, as AI gets more powerful, we integrate wisdom modules or use AI to generate wisdom in society concurrently. The idea is that if AI can rapidly accelerate intelligence, maybe we should use it to also accelerate wisdom, both in the AI and in humans who interact with it.

From a rationalist perspective, one might break down wisdom into sub-problems like: value learning, error avoidance, robustness under distributional shift, multiobjective balancing, etc. Each of these can be tackled technically to some extent, but the holistic integration (which is what wisdom is by nature) is hard to formalize. That hasn’t stopped people from trying: e.g., there are attempts to create **“wisdom metrics”** or use AI to detect when a particular course of action would violate common-sense wisdom (like AI debate where one AI proposes an action and another AI tries to find catastrophic outcomes).

Another rationalist perspective is considering *human wisdom development* as part of AI alignment strategy. If researchers and decision-makers themselves aren’t wise, how can they create a wise AI? Worley made this personal: \*“My plan for creating wise AI is first get wiser myself, then help people working on AI safety get wiser, in hope that wise AI researchers can create wise, aligned AI.”\*. This is a very direct statement that the **human element** matters – wisdom is somewhat contagious or needs to be embodied by the creators to imbue the creation. He acknowledges not being sure how to create wise AI yet because we’re not exactly sure what wisdom fully is, but his approach is incremental self-improvement in wisdom. Interestingly, he credits practicing Zen Buddhism and studying philosophy/psychology as key to him getting wiser over a decade, which shows a rationalist turning to an ancient wisdom tradition to improve alignment capacity. That is metamodern in spirit – bridging rational thought and contemplative practice.

**Moral Development and AI:** Effective altruism also deals with *moral expansiveness* (expanding our moral circle to include all humans, animals, future generations). This is a *wisdom trajectory* – historically we see moral wisdom in individuals like MLK or Gandhi, who advocated for recognizing the humanity of all. EA’s focus on *impartial altruism* (every human life has equal value, etc.) is in line with a very high stage of moral reasoning (Stage 6 in Kohlberg, universal principle of justice and care). If we succeed in aligning AI with *actual* human values, but current human values are short-sighted or parochial, we might still get bad outcomes (for instance, if an AI aligns with a dictatorship’s values, it’s bad for humanity). So some argue alignment work must include *raising human values to a more wise level*. There’s interplay here: building superintelligent AI might force humanity to “grow up” fast because if we remain tribal or foolish, those could be reflected in AI to disastrous effect.

In summary, rationalist/EA perspectives are increasingly acknowledging wisdom:

* They conceptualize a wise AI as one that would not do things like Goodhart out-of-distribution weirdness, and has a robust, well-calibrated understanding of human values.  
* Some propose practical steps like training AIs on human philosophy or creating AI “judges” that estimate what a wiser human would do.  
* There’s also the notion of *superalignment*, which OpenAI has mentioned: aligning AI with **human intent** and **human values** even as it surpasses our understanding. One could interpret that as making AI understand the spirit behind our instructions – effectively imbuing it with common-sense wisdom about what we *mean* rather than what we *say*.

To implement wisdom in AI, a few technical directions have been floated:

* **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)** to learn human values from behavior, but augmented with models of rationality or virtue.  
* **Debate and amplification** methods, where AI assists in evaluating consequences of proposals (i.e., AI helps us be more wise by exploring outcomes we can’t foresee).  
* Embedding AI in *human oversight* processes where diverse perspectives are included, to mimic wisdom’s integrative nature.  
* Ensuring AI has some form of *theory of mind* and empathy for humans (so it understands not just what we say but what we truly need).  
* Multilevel world-models where the AI knows about physics, psychology, ethics, etc., and can reason on all those levels (like a wise person draws on many types of understanding, not just one domain).

The rationalist community also often references that an aligned superintelligence might still cause problems if humans misuse it or if society is not wise enough to handle it. For example, what if we align AI to follow orders of a government, but that government is oppressive? Then the AI is aligned in a narrow sense but still doing unwise, unethical things. Thus alignment discourse inevitably broadens to “aligning AI with **the true good**, not just stated directives.” That gets philosophical very quickly (what is the true good?), essentially pulling in ethics and wisdom traditions.

**Effective Altruism’s Role:** Many effective altruists strive to be *effective* which implies being *rational* and *informed*, but also *altruistic* which is a value (compassion). So EA as a movement is trying to combine head and heart. There have been internal critiques that EA can be too coldly calculating (e.g., focusing on numbers over individual stories), which some say is a wisdom gap – ignoring qualitative, emotional knowledge. The movement has responded by embracing more pluralistic approaches (like community building, acknowledging uncertainty, etc.). This reflects a microcosm of integrating wisdom: calibrating analytical rigor with moral intuition and human connection.

In the context of metamodern axiology, rationalists and EAs are key players because they actually take seriously the idea of *optimizing the world according to values*. They are, in a sense, trying to engineer wisdom outcomes (end suffering, ensure long-term survival, etc.) albeit through analytic methods. Metamodernism would encourage them to also use *depth psychologies, spiritual insights, and narrative* in addition to utilitarian calculus – thus enriching their approach with more wisdom sources.

In conclusion for this section: The alignment community is recognizing that aligning AI with *explicit goals* might fail unless those goals encapsulate wisdom. There is growing interest in how to instill AI with principles like not coveting *literally* every resource (some notion of moderation or respecting intrinsic values), how to have AI understand human normative context (our paradoxical nature, as Clayton said, human nature is contradictory which a wise AI must grasp), and even how to use AI to *teach us* to be wiser so we make better choices pre- and post-AGI. Wisdom in AI alignment discourse thus appears both as a goal (make AI wise) and a means (humans become wiser to align AI better). This sets the stage to discuss what a **wisdom-guided AI** might look like if achieved.

### **2.3 Wisdom-Guided AI: The Idea of a “Superwise” ASI**

If we project into the future: suppose we succeed in creating an **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** that is not only super-smart but also *“super-wise.”* What would that entail, and why might it be a game-changer for alignment and humanity? Let’s call this hypothetical entity **Superwise AI** – an AI with perhaps vastly superior capacity for calculation *and* deeply grounded judgment, compassion, and understanding of complex values. In effect, an AI that amplifies not just human intelligence, but human wisdom.

**Defining a Wisdom-Guided AI:** A wisdom-guided AI would have its cognition and decision-making oriented by *the kinds of principles wise humans follow* (though possibly to an even greater degree). That means:

* It can **discern the true goals behind instructions** and resist pursuing actions that technically fulfill a goal but betray its intent (avoiding perverse instantiations).  
* It balances multiple objectives and stakeholders in a fair, farsighted way – e.g., negotiating between economic, environmental, and social goals to find solutions that are sustainable and just, rather than optimizing one at total expense of others.  
* It recognizes **moral constraints** innately; it wouldn’t, for instance, sacrifice a minority for convenience unless absolutely no better option existed and even then would deeply question the action (like a wise person agonizes over causing harm even for a greater good, seeking alternatives).  
* It has a model of **human psychology and well-being** that is rich and evidence-based, so it actually understands what causes human flourishing (not just what humans *say* they want). This might include understanding the importance of autonomy, creativity, relationships – things that a naive utilitarian calculus might undervalue but wisdom cherishes.  
* It is **self-reflective**: it monitors its own reasoning for biases or errors, a sort of meta-cognitive safety. It might simulate “If I do X, will I later realize that was a terrible idea due to something I overlooked?” This is like an inbuilt wisdom check.  
* It could **learn from human wisdom literature** – imagine training it on philosophical and spiritual texts from around the world, not just on Reddit. It might “read” Confucius, Epictetus, the Buddha, Shakespeare, MLK, etc., and integrate those perspectives. While texts alone won’t instill wisdom, combined with real-world feedback, they could give it a breadth of insight into human values and experiences.  
* A superwise AI might also have something akin to **bounded ambition**: rather than monomaniacally maximizing a number, it might approach goals with a sense of balance. For example, it might determine an optimal point to stop optimizing one thing to preserve another (like, "we could push this cure to market faster but doing more safety trials is wiser, so we’ll delay a bit for that quality assurance").

Crucially, a superwise AI should be able to say *“No”* to unwise human commands in a benevolent way – similar to how a wise advisor might refuse executing a foolish king’s order and instead counsel a better path. This is tricky because it touches on AI potentially overriding direct human instructions (which is normally a safety no-no). But consider: if a panicked human asks an aligned AI to do something terribly destructive (“shut off all power grids now\!” in a moment of anger or fear), a wise AI might either refuse or find a way to achieve the underlying goal (maybe the human is afraid of some threat that can be met differently) without causing catastrophe. This is basically programming AI with *judgment* and *common sense*, not blind obedience. OpenAI’s concept of AI being “helpful, truthful, and harmless” hints at this – the AI tries to do what you want, tells the truth, but also refuses if it would cause harm. That harm-avoidance is a simple form of wisdom constraint.

**Moral Lever / Overseer:** One vision is using a superwise AI as a kind of **moral advisor or governor** in complex decisions. For instance, future governments or individuals might consult an AI on ethical dilemmas because the AI can simulate outcomes and highlight moral trade-offs without emotional bias. If truly wise, it might give advice like a sagacious elder: factoring not only logic but compassion and long-term repercussions. Some fiction and futurists have imagined benevolent AI nannies or “Protector” systems that gently guide humanity (as in Iain M. Banks’ Culture novels, Minds are superintelligent AIs that broadly shepherd society but allow individuals freedom – they are portrayed as mostly benevolent because they understand and value what people value).

However, there’s also a caution: Who defines wisdom? If we say “we want a wise AI,” we have to encode or learn what wisdom is. That could be tricky and lead to conflict (different cultures have different takes, though as we saw, there’s significant overlap). Possibly the approach is to aim for some *meta-values* – like *coherence, benevolence, fairness, understanding*. The EA forum definition (avoid large-scale errors and have good goals) is a start. A superwise AI could be one that, as that post suggests, *improves the wisdom of decisions around it.* For example, it could serve as a *“wisdom amplification device”* in governance: analyzing policy proposals for unforeseen consequences, pointing out when short-term interests conflict with long-term ones, etc., thereby nudging decision makers to think more wisely. In a sense, aligning AI to wisdom means AI’s utility function might be something like *“maximize the coherent enlightened preference of humanity”* – which loops back to that CEV concept or something akin to it.

**Superwise vs. Superintelligent:** In practice, building a superwise AI might require solving not just technical AI problems but also cracking some philosophical ones: how to formally represent complex human values, how to handle moral uncertainty, etc. Some researchers like Stuart Russell advocate *inverse reinforcement learning plus a notion of uncertainty over the utility function* – essentially meaning the AI should never be too confident it knows the true utility and should be open to correction (humility). That is an approach to bake in humility/wisdom: AI maintains an uncertainty and always seeks clarification from human behavior/preferences.

We might consider incremental steps: current AI (like large language models) can be fine-tuned with human feedback to follow social norms and ethical guidelines (basically making them *somewhat wise by proxy*). They still make mistakes, but they are much more aligned than a raw model. Future iterations could incorporate explicit ethical reasoning modules or be cross-trained on moral philosophy debates. DeepMind’s *Alignment* team or OpenAI’s *Constitutional AI* experiment (Anthropic’s approach of giving the AI a “constitution” of principles to follow) are early attempts at injecting normative constraints that resonate with wisdom (like “choose the response most supportive of human values such as honesty, integrity...” etc.).

If a true Superwise ASI were achieved, it might greatly alleviate the fear of an unfriendly AI, because it wouldn’t just be smart in pursuing a goal blindly – it would *understand context and consequence* to a very advanced degree. It could be the ultimate *safety controller*. Some have even posited using one AI to monitor another (like an oversight AI) – a wise overseer ensuring other AIs don’t do something stupid. This “supervisor AI” idea only works if the supervisor is indeed wiser or at least more aligned with human values than the subordinate.

**Risks and Governance of Superwise AI:** It’s worth noting, a superwise AI should presumably avoid the classical failure of benevolent tyrants – imposing a utopia that strips agency. A wise entity values autonomy and growth, so it wouldn’t (we hope) lock humans into padded cells for their “own good.” Instead, it might empower humans to become wiser too (teacher role). In philosophical terms, we’d prefer an AI that treats us somewhat the way a wise parent treats a child: guiding, protecting from fatal errors, but also encouraging the child to learn, even if that involves minor mistakes, and eventually giving them freedom. Except in this case, humanity is the child that eventually might mature. This paternalism is contentious, but if the alternative is a child playing with a loaded gun (i.e., humans with godlike tech), some guidance is warranted. The best scenario is co-evolution: AI helps us become better; we give AI feedback to remain aligned – a virtuous cycle.

One could imagine a far future where AI and human society are so integrated that what is “AI’s wisdom” and what is “cultural wisdom” merge. E.g., AI might administer many systems according to values that humanity collectively has agreed on. If those values are wise, then effectively we have instantiated metamodern axiology into our infrastructure.

This segues to governance: how do we integrate wisdom into not just AI but *institutions* more broadly?

### **2.4 Metamodern Governance, Solarpunk, and Techno-Humanist Visions Integrating Wisdom**

Beyond AI, **governance and societal structures** themselves need an upgrade of wisdom. Metamodern political thought often centers on updating democracy, economy, and culture to address modern complexities. We’ll explore a few interrelated visionary trends: **metamodern governance reforms**, the **solarpunk movement**, and broader **techno-humanism**, all of which seek to align technology and policy with human flourishing, guided by wisdom and values rather than narrow metrics or ideologies.

**Metamodern Governance:** Hanzi Freinacht and others speak of a metamodern political paradigm where policies are designed with **depth (psychological insight), complexity, and long-term thinking**. In *Nordic Ideology*, Freinacht outlines new forms of politics he calls Listening Society, emphasizing **inner development** of citizens and politicians. This means measuring success not only by economic growth but by increases in things like mental well-being, sense of meaning, and yes, wisdom among the populace. There are concrete proposals such as:

* **Democratization of personal development:** ensuring everyone has access to education that fosters critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and existential reflection (so the average person can reach higher developmental stages, in Kegan terms). This would produce a wiser electorate over time.  
* **Existential politics:** acknowledging citizens have spiritual/existential needs (for meaning, belonging, growth) that politics usually ignores. A metamodern government might incorporate practices like citizens’ assemblies that not only deliberate policy but also allow storytelling, cultural expression, and collective sense-making – harnessing communal wisdom.  
* **Evidence-based policy** with a twist: not just what works short-term, but what cultivates long-term resilience and happiness. For instance, instead of reactive health policy, adopt preventive, holistic health policy (including mental health, community building).  
* **Transnational and intergenerational justice:** metamodern governance tries to solve global problems with global cooperation (transcending nation-centric shortsightedness) and takes into account future generations (something like applying a “Seventh Generation principle” in law, or like Wales’ Commissioner for Future Generations, an actual office that exists to review legislation impact on the unborn). These are institutional moves to bake in wisdom (future-thinking) in governance.

We already see early moves: some countries have **well-being budgets** (New Zealand’s budget that prioritizes well-being indicators), cities doing participatory budgeting (engaging citizen wisdom in allocating funds), and the concept of *deliberative democracy* through **citizen assemblies** is gaining traction (e.g., Ireland’s citizen assembly on abortion, France’s on climate – randomly selected citizens given time and info can produce remarkably nuanced and wise recommendations, avoiding partisan extremes). These assemblies often demonstrate that a microcosm of society, if given a chance to dialogue deeply, leans toward balanced, compassionate solutions – essentially pulling on collective wisdom rather than knee-jerk referendum. Metamodernists advocate scaling this approach: using **“wise democracy”** forums to guide complex decisions, effectively injecting more reflective human input than just simple voting.

Another metamodern idea is integrating **scientific foresight** and **spiritual insight** in decision-making. For example, creating **foresight units** in government that use techniques like scenario planning (pioneered by futurists like Peter Schwartz) to anticipate challenges, working alongside ethicists or even wisdom councils that consider values. This multi-perspective approach fits metamodern principles (integration of rational and subjective dimensions).

**Solarpunk:** Solarpunk is a cultural and artistic movement that envisions optimistic, sustainable futures. The term combines “solar” (clean energy, ecology) and “punk” (counterculture, DIY ethos) to imagine a world that has overcome environmental and social challenges through community-driven innovation, renewable energy, and harmony with nature. It’s basically a narrative and aesthetic of a *wise future civilization*.

Solarpunk scenarios depict cities full of greenery, decentralized solar power grids, mutual aid, and high tech that is *human-scaled and regenerative*. It’s important because it provides an **inspiring image of what wise use of technology and economy could look like**, as opposed to the grim dystopias of cyberpunk. As Freinacht notes, *“visions of solarpunk societies may be our best bet”* for enticing people toward moving beyond current capitalist democracies without losing freedoms and living standards. Solarpunk uses **art and storytelling** to communicate metamodern axiology: it’s simultaneously idealistic (utopian aspirations) and pragmatic (solutions focus like urban gardens, community solar cooperatives are already emerging).

Freinacht calls solarpunk a “gateway drug into metamodernism”, meaning it’s a tangible way to get mainstream buy-in for deeper change by showing something beautiful and relatable (plant-filled neighborhoods, artisanal makers, etc.) rather than dry theory. Solarpunk strongly integrates values of **sustainability, community, creativity, and egalitarianism** – all aspects of wisdom applied to design.

For example, a solarpunk governance concept might be **bioregionalism**: organizing policy based on natural ecological regions and including the voice of the ecosystem (like New Zealand granting legal personhood to a river, effectively acknowledging nature’s stake). This reflects indigenous wisdom traditions combined with modern legal frameworks.

In solarpunk economics, circular economy (no waste, everything reused) is key – wisdom of nature’s cycles guiding industry. Also, there's emphasis on *localized resilience* (like local food, energy) combined with global connectivity (sharing open-source designs). It’s a fusion of high tech and old wisdom (e.g., permaculture principles).

A metamodern solarpunk manifesto (like one by Joe Lightfoot) mashes up ideas from Hanzi Freinacht, Seth Abramson, etc., implying synergy of political metamodernism with the solarpunk aesthetic. The synergy is that metamodernism provides the developmental and structural theory, while solarpunk provides the visceral, motivational vision and prototypes.

One real-life trend akin to solarpunk is the growth of **“Smart City” meets “Sustainable City”** projects – but often they lack the punk aspect (citizen empowerment). A wisdom-infused approach ensures community participation (so it’s not just top-down tech but co-created). Indeed, Freinacht highlights that solarpunk’s participatory nature can deepen democracy – people get involved in designing their parks, energy systems, etc., which also *educates and empowers them*, creating a virtuous cycle of civic wisdom. He mentions that if not guided well, authoritarian regimes might co-opt solarpunk aesthetics without democratic substance (like building eco-cities that are still oppressive), hence stressing it must go hand-in-hand with democratic deepening.

**Techno-Humanist Visions:** Techno-humanism (not to be confused with Harari’s use where he contrasts it with Dataism) here we mean philosophies that affirm using technology to enhance human potential and solve human problems while maintaining human-centric values. It’s a sort of middle path between traditional humanism and transhumanism. A techno-humanist with a metamodern view would argue for technology development that is **explicitly guided by ethics, empathy, and human oversight** – essentially making tech serve the *highest human values* (wisdom, compassion, creativity).

Examples:

* The **Asilomar AI Principles** or similar initiatives (like the recent call for AI pauses or regulation) come from a place of wanting to ensure AI development is tied to safety and human benefit (some of those principles highlight broadly “align AI with human values,” “share benefits broadly”). That’s a starting governance framework, albeit voluntary.  
* **Human-Centered Design** in tech: designing user experiences that empower rather than exploit. The field of **Digital Wellbeing** (like app timers, “do not disturb” modes) is a minor manifestation of trying to correct course so tech aligns with our wellness (countering demand engineering).  
* **Bioethics and Genome Editing**: Another area where wisdom is needed – e.g., applying CRISPR with caution and for clearly beneficial uses (like curing diseases) while avoiding a slippery slope to designer babies that could increase inequality. Global forums like the WHO’s ethics committees, etc., are attempts at bringing wisdom to biotechnological advancement.

The concept of **“Wise governance”** might also involve multi-stakeholder councils for emerging tech – including philosophers, citizen representatives, scientists, and maybe even an AI advisor in the future – all to ensure a plurality of perspectives (a hallmark of wise decisions).

There are also *solarpunk and techno-humanist overlaps with political movements* like **solarpunk anarchism** or **cosmo-localism** (produce locally, share globally). All of these emphasize **resilience, equity, and wise resource use**. They are against reckless exploitation.

**Integration into Policy and Structures:** To solidify these visions, proposals include:

* **Future Assemblies**: like citizen assemblies but focusing specifically on foresight (some jurisdictions have started doing “kids’ council” for climate or “100-year planning committees”).  
* **Constitutional Amendments** to protect future generations’ rights (as was attempted in some countries) – institutionalizing long-term responsibility.  
* **Measurement**: new indices like Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) or Happy Planet Index that attempt to quantify success more holistically than GDP, so governments have incentive to be wise stewards of well-being, not just economy.  
* **Education reforms**: as mentioned, teaching wisdom. Interestingly, the **Inner Development Goals (IDGs)** initiative (a group of academics and practitioners aligning with UN SDGs) has listed qualities like mindfulness, empathy, and critical thinking as necessary “inner” skills to achieve sustainable development. That’s a real-world example of trying to bring wisdom into global development discourse.

Techno-humanist wisdom also calls for bridging the **digital divide** and ensuring empowerment: technology should not just be in hands of elites – as that can create a wisdom gap where decisions don’t account for the marginalized. Inclusive innovation processes (co-design with communities) produce wiser outcomes because they incorporate experiential knowledge from those on the ground.

**Solarpunk Governance in Action (Hypothetical):** Imagine a city run on solarpunk principles: the city council includes an *Assembly of All Beings* concept (an idea from deep ecology where someone represents nature’s voice), maybe via a Commissioner for Environment who must approve that plans won’t harm biodiversity. Urban planning decisions are made with extensive community workshops (playful, with AR simulation of how a park could look), and an AI system helps model the long-term effects (e.g., “if we widen this highway, here’s impact on pollution and public health over 30 years”). The decision might then lean toward building a tram line instead because the AI and community voices highlight the wiser choice for quality of life and climate. Economy-wise, the city might have cooperative businesses prioritized, energy co-ops, and a local currency to boost certain sustainable behaviors. All these are seeds already present in various places (like Transition Towns, co-op movements, etc.) – metamodern governance would network these seeds and support scaling what works.

**Cultural Evolution and Wisdom**: All these governance and societal changes are part of what one might call *cultural evolution toward wisdom*. Just as individuals can grow, societies can mature. Historically, we moved from rule by raw might (ancient empires) to more law-based rule (classical and modern states) to democratic rule (with rights, etc.). Each step required expanding the moral circle and complexity of coordination. The next step could be something like a *global coordination with local autonomy, guided by wisdom*. It might involve *planetary governance* for certain issues (like a strong international climate body with enforcement power) while empowering local communities to adapt wisely.

Hanzi Freinacht suggests that metamodern politics in Nordic Ideology revolve around optimizing *subjective well-being* through six new forms of politics (like democratization of personal development, Gemeinschaft politics focusing on community, Existential politics focusing on meaning, etc.). If implemented, those could produce a populace that is more content, more thoughtful, and more supportive of wise policy rather than populist quick fixes.

**The Role of Tech**: We often come back to technology. Techno-humanism isn’t anti-tech; it’s about guiding tech. Tools like **AI-driven policymaking assistance**, **blockchain for transparency**, **sensors for environmental monitoring**, etc., can be part of metamodern governance. But the ethos is to use them to *augment human wisdom*, not replace it or amplify folly. For example, if social media algorithms currently amplify outrage (folly), a wise redesign would amplify constructive dialogue (some platforms are experimenting with designs to foster empathy, such as showing users how their tweets might appear to someone with different views, etc.).

**Risks and Mitigation**: A wise society also knows things can still go wrong and sets up **failsafes and learning loops**. Metamodern governance would likely be very iterative: test policies small-scale, gather feedback (data \+ lived experience), adjust – somewhat like agile development but for policy. That requires humility to change course – a wise trait – rather than bullheadedly sticking to a plan because of politics.

To connect to metamodern axiology explicitly: metamodern values often listed include *sincerity, hope, play, irony, pluralism, wholeness*. Wisdom is like the meta-value enabling balancing those. It allows one to be hopeful yet realistic (balance idealism and pragmatism), sincere yet acknowledge irony, etc. In governance, this translates to being visionary but not naive, principled but not dogmatic.

Finally, metamodern cultural evolution would position **wisdom as a central organizing principle**, which we will synthesize next.

### **2.5 Synthesis: Wisdom as a Central Principle in Metamodern Axiology and Cultural Evolution**

Drawing together all these threads – the concept of wisdom, its development, the challenges we face, the envisioned solutions – we arrive at a pivotal proposition: **Wisdom should be a central organizing principle for the values of the future.** In a metamodern axiology, wisdom isn’t just one value among many; it is what orchestrates and harmonizes other values (like compassion, freedom, equality, sustainability, creativity) into a coherent whole that can guide both human behavior and our increasingly powerful machines.

Let’s break down what it means to position wisdom at the core of cultural evolution in a metamodern context:

* **Wisdom as Integrator of Value Dialectics:** Metamodernism often talks about oscillation or integration between opposites (like modern optimism and postmodern skepticism). Wisdom is precisely the faculty needed to reconcile such opposites without trivializing either. For example, balancing tradition and innovation – a wise culture honors the past’s lessons (tradition) while adapting to new information and needs (innovation). In metamodern axiology, values are not static commandments (as in traditional societies) nor entirely relative (as in postmodern thought), but **contextual and evolving**, guided by the telos of increasing well-being and understanding. Wisdom provides the **context-sensitivity** to know which value to emphasize when: e.g., sometimes freedom must yield a bit to compassion (like mask mandates in a pandemic), other times compassion must be balanced with truth (like giving difficult feedback kindly but clearly). A metamodern values framework would explicitly emphasize *training society* in making these judgments – through education, public discourse norms, and institutional design that requires deliberation.

* **Cultural Evolution and Developmental Stage:** If one views society as moving through developmental stages (integral theory, etc.), metamodernity is often seen as a new stage where **integral thinking** becomes mainstream. This stage correlates with what we’ve described as wisdom in individuals (e.g., Kegan Stage 5 thinking in a whole society). Therefore, one could say the measure of reaching metamodernity is the degree to which wisdom (integrative, reflective, compassionate thought) pervades culture. This means more citizens capable of complex perspective-taking, more leaders who are psychologically developed, more media that present nuanced analysis instead of sensationalism, and more synergy between science and spirituality.

* **Wisdom Institutions:** In a metamodern society, we may see institutions whose explicit mission is to cultivate and utilize wisdom. Think of a *Ministry of Future* or *Institute of Collective Wisdom* at the international level that continuously scans for existential risks, moral dilemmas, and convenes wise minds (diverse experts, elders, youth, AI advisors) to propose guidance. This might sound utopian, but some early forms exist (e.g., UN’s Future Forum, various futurist think tanks, and coalitions like the Club of Rome that provide holistic analyses). The difference is in giving them actual weight in decision-making, akin to a fourth branch of governance (executive, legislative, judicial, plus a deliberative/long-term branch).

* **Alignment of Systems with Wisdom:** When wisdom guides the value system, everything else – economy, technology, education – can align accordingly. For instance:

  * **Economy:** We might measure a “Wisdom Economy” by how much it enhances quality of life and virtuous cycles rather than raw output. Companies might be evaluated not just on profit but on their *“wisdom impact”* – do their products make people’s lives meaningfully better without nasty side effects? (Already ESG metrics attempt some of that).  
  * **Technology:** R\&D agendas would prioritize projects that address root causes of suffering or enable human potential (like clean energy, medical cures, learning tools) over those that simply exploit consumerism. And within projects, caution and ethics (wisdom checks) become standard procedure.  
  * **Education:** Imagine report cards that grade not only academic subjects but “wisdom-related competencies” – collaboration, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, emotional regulation. Some progressive schools do assess things like that qualitatively. On a societal level, there could be encouragement for lifelong learning communities – essentially building the “wisdom infrastructure” akin to libraries, but for dialogue and experience sharing (perhaps combining physical community centers with online platforms that connect mentors and learners globally).  
  * **Media and Narrative:** A culture oriented around wisdom would celebrate wise role models (not just rich celebrities). Media would elevate stories of growth, reconciliation, and innovation in service of humanity. Metamodern art already tends toward sincerity and earnest exploration (in contrast to the detached irony of late 20th century). This can foster collective emotional wisdom – art helps societies process trauma and imagine alternatives, which is a wise function.  
* **Global Ethic:** Many have called for a *global ethic* (Hans Küng and the Parliament of World Religions drafted one in the 90s). A metamodern global ethic likely emphasizes unity in diversity, the golden rule, and stewardship of Earth. Wisdom is what allows a global ethic to actually function – it is the capacity to empathize beyond one’s tribe and foresee consequences beyond one’s lifetime. By centering wisdom, metamodern culture would actively work on expanding empathy (through cultural exchange, digital pen-pals, etc.) and foresight (through scenario education, science fiction that instructs).

* **Measuring Success:** How do we know if we are becoming wiser as a species? This is tricky, but one could track proxies: reductions in war and violence (the better angels of our nature), better management of commons (like CO2 emissions leveling off then decreasing, species extinctions halted), lower rates of addiction and mental illness (some indication we’re handling modern life better), and higher levels of reported trust and life satisfaction. One could also track participation in wisdom practices – e.g., how many people meditate, go to therapy, attend town halls, etc. If those increase, likely so does wisdom. Alternatively, as Nicholas Maxwell argued, academia could shift to *wisdom-inquiry* – measuring how research solves actual human problems and contributes to wiser policies. For example, a university might highlight interdisciplinary programs on sustainability or human flourishing as its star departments, rather than, say, abstract fields disconnected from real-world improvement.

* **Resilience through Wisdom:** Cultural evolution that centers wisdom is more **adaptive and resilient**. We face unprecedented challenges; a wise society can navigate them where a fragmented or short-sighted one would collapse. Wisdom helps with **sense-making** in a complex, info-saturated world – filtering signal from noise, identifying what matters (relevance realization again). It also fosters **cooperation** – an existential must, given global threats. In evolutionary terms, groups that cultivate internal wisdom might outcompete those that don’t, because they can coordinate better and avoid self-inflicted disasters (some argue this is why democracies have often outlasted tyrannies, because collective input and error-correction yield wiser governance in the long run).

* **The Human-AI Co-evolution:** If AI continues to progress, either we manage to align it or not. If we do, likely part of that alignment will entail encoding our highest values. If we have not clarified those values (lack wisdom), the AI might align to something dumb or destructive. Conversely, if we emphasize wisdom now, we can shape AI to truly reflect it. And then a superwise AI can accelerate our cultural evolution further, in a hopefully positive feedback loop – guiding us through tough decisions, providing insight into complex systems (like climate) to help us act wisely. One could imagine that in a few centuries, people might look back and categorize our time as the transition from *Homo Sapiens* (wise in name only, as some joke) to *truly sapient* beings augmented by AI – essentially fulfilling the potential of sapience (wisdom) which is in our species name.

* **Spiritual Renaissance:** Many sense a need for a spiritual or meaning renaissance without returning to old dogmas. Wisdom is often the secular term for spirituality’s fruits (enlightenment in Buddhism is basically ultimate wisdom). A metamodern culture might cultivate *secular sacredness* – experiences of awe (space travel, nature, art) that imbue people with humility and connection. That fosters wisdom by reminding us of our small yet significant place in the larger whole. Some foresee something like a *global civic religion* of interdependence and reverence for life emerging – not a religion in strict sense, but a shared narrative and practice set that encourages wisdom (like global Earth Day rituals, meditation flash mobs, etc.).

* **Moral Competence as Key Thread:** The user specifically mentioned emphasizing developmental models of *moral competence*. Indeed, moral competence (ability to handle moral problems) is a component of wisdom. If metamodern society trains moral competence (through say, ethics courses that involve action, or service learning, or cross-cultural dialogue programs), people become both more tolerant and more principled – a combination needed for global harmony. Efforts like **Model UN, Erasmus student exchange, international volunteerism** also build empathy and perspective-taking, which are subskills of wisdom.

In conclusion, the broad vision is that **wisdom becomes to metamodernity what reason was to modernity and what faith was to premodernity** – the orienting ideal. In the Enlightenment, “reason” was the catch-cry (with tremendous progress but also reductionism). In the medieval era, “faith” or “religious devotion” was central (with social cohesion but also dogmatism). In metamodern times, **“wisdom” – a union of reason and empathy, science and spirituality – could be the central ideal**. This would mean the highest status in society isn’t wealth or power per se, but *wisdom and service*. You can already see glimmers: e.g., in some communities, people highly respect those seen as having insight or integrity (think of widely respected figures like the Dalai Lama, or Nelson Mandela – who were valued for their wisdom and moral leadership).

This pivot to wisdom doesn’t come without challenges: it requires cultural buy-in and probably some crises that make the status quo untenable (unfortunately, humans often learn the hard way). But crises can be catalysts for cultural evolution. If climate disasters, pandemics, or AI close calls shock us enough, they might trigger a collective realization that “we need to be wiser.” Ideally, proactive effort gets us there with less trauma, but history shows societies often need a push.

Nonetheless, as Maxwell insisted, it’s not a luxury but a necessity now. The encouraging aspect is that unlike raw intelligence or force, wisdom isn’t zero-sum – one person’s wisdom can benefit others, and sharing wisdom generally multiplies it. Knowledge can be hoarded, but wisdom by nature calls for communication and compassion, so a society centered on it could be very positive-sum.

We can envision metamodern axiology in perhaps a succinct form: **“Optimize for Wisdom.”** That could mean always asking in policy: what course of action would we regard as wise looking back 50 years from now? And similarly, in AI: design objectives not just to maximize utility, but to *approximate what a wise entity would do*. If multiple frameworks (philosophical, spiritual, rational) converge on similar wise conclusions, that’s a strong hint of the right path.

In a way, wisdom as North Star simplifies complexity: Instead of juggling dozens of metrics (GDP, Gini, HDI, CO2 ppm, etc.) separately, a wisdom-oriented view naturally incorporates those factors (because you can’t be wise and ignore environment, or wise and allow extreme inequality, etc.). It seeks an *optimum balance* for the flourishing of life.

To wrap up: The metamodern future, if it realizes this vision, might be characterized by councils of diverse elders and youth advising governments, algorithms pruned by ethical oversight, schools teaching meditation alongside math, economies measured by well-being, and a shared global ethos that humanity’s purpose is not domination or accumulation, but *realization*: realization of our potential to understand, to care, and to create in harmony with the wider world. That is essentially a **wisdom culture**.

In sum, **wisdom can function as the organizing force that coordinates human values in the metamodern age**, guiding technology, social systems, and personal development. By elevating wisdom, we align our progress with what truly matters, and we stand a better chance of surviving and thriving through the 21st century and beyond – wisely.

## **Bibliography**

1. **Clayton, Vivian (1982). “Wisdom and intelligence: the nature and function of knowledge in the later years.”** *International Journal of Aging and Human Development 15*(4): 315-321. – *An early psychological study distinguishing wisdom from intelligence. Clayton defines intelligence as the ability to think logically and abstractly, whereas wisdom is the ability to grasp human nature and life paradoxes. The paper emphasizes that intelligence focuses on “how” to do things, while wisdom asks “should” we do them, considering long-term consequences for self and others.*

2. **Thesaurus.com (2023). “Wisdom vs. Intelligence: Is There a Difference?”** – *An accessible article explaining differences in usage between intelligence and wisdom. It notes intelligence often refers to academic learning and quick thinking, whereas wisdom refers to life experience and insight into human nature. Wisdom is described as “knowledge of what is true or right coupled with just judgment as to action,” highlighting its moral and judgment aspect beyond raw intelligence.*

3. **Ardelt, Monika (2003). “Empirical Assessment of a Three-Dimensional Wisdom Scale.”** – *Monika Ardelt is a wisdom researcher who conceptualized wisdom as a combination of three dimensions: cognitive, reflective, and affective (compassionate). In an interview, Ardelt explains these components: a **cognitive** dimension involving deep understanding of life’s complexities and acceptance of uncertainty; a **reflective** dimension involving self-awareness and perspective-taking from multiple viewpoints; and an **affective** dimension involving sympathetic and compassionate love for others. Ardelt’s research finds that wisdom (so defined) correlates with life satisfaction and the ability to cope with hardships.*

4. **Hursthouse, Rosalind & Pettigrove, Glen (2018). “Virtue Ethics” – Section 1.2: Practical Wisdom.** *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.* – *This reference outlines the role of **phronesis** (practical wisdom) in virtue ethics. It explains that virtues like compassion or honesty, if not guided by wisdom, can misfire (e.g., honesty “to a fault”). Practical wisdom is what allows a person to do the right thing in the right way – it comes typically with experience and maturity. The entry describes the practically wise as those who “understand what is truly worthwhile and how to live well,” having the ability to recognize what’s morally salient in a situation. It connects wisdom with knowing how to secure real benefits without falling prey to shortsightedness or recklessness.*

5. **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2014). “Wisdom.”** – *This encyclopedia entry (author: Sharon Ryan) surveys philosophical approaches to wisdom. It discusses Socratic wisdom (knowing what one does not know) and why simple “humility” theories are insufficient. It covers distinctions like theoretical vs practical wisdom, and notes that many philosophers consider wisdom as fundamentally linked to knowing how to live well (a view shared by Nozick, Kekes, etc.). The SEP entry also mentions Nicholas Maxwell’s critique that modern academia lacks focus on wisdom.*

6. **Maxwell, Nicholas (2015). “Can the World Learn Wisdom?”** *Philosophy Now, Issue 108\.* – *Maxwell argues that humanity’s primary need is to become wiser. He famously states, “The crisis of our times is that we have science without wisdom. All our current global problems have arisen as a result.”. He calls for an “intellectual revolution” shifting academia’s aim from knowledge to wisdom – meaning all fields should ultimately help us make wiser decisions that lead to a better world. He sees learning wisdom as an urgent survival issue, advocating that we reform institutions to prioritize global welfare, cooperative problem-solving, and understanding of values.*

7. **Alexander, Scott (2014). “Meditations on Moloch.”** (Slate Star Codex blog). – *A profound essay examining how competitive systems can lead to suboptimal or dreadful outcomes despite each actor behaving “rationally” for themselves. Alexander uses “Moloch” as a metaphor for these destructive dynamics (from game theory and coordination failures). For example, individual rational farmers overgrazing leads to collective ruin. The essay catalogs many such traps (evolutionary arms races, markets driving down wages, etc.) and laments the lack of a built-in mechanism to escape them. It underscores the need for **wisdom and coordination** to overcome such traps – essentially arguing that without deliberate cooperation (a product of wise foresight and sacrifice of immediate gain), Moloch devours all values.*

8. **Edmonds, Duane (2023). “Meditations on Moloch” (summary).** *Duane’s Musings blog*. – *A summary of Alexander’s essay that concisely defines Moloch dynamics: “people, acting rationally in their individual interests, inadvertently cause collectively negative outcomes.”. It gives examples like environmental degradation (tragedy of commons), arms races, etc., in plain terms. Edmonds notes that naming this pattern helps in devising solutions – e.g., modifying rules and institutions to encourage cooperation over competition. This summary is useful to quickly grasp why unregulated competition (lacking wise oversight) can undermine human values, supporting the case for wiser governance and norms.*

9. **“Alignment at Large: Bending the Arc of History Towards Life-Affirming Futures” (2024).** *LessWrong post by user “welfvh”.* – *This essay broadens the AI alignment concept to aligning the whole system of **technological capitalism** with life and wisdom. It describes the current world-system as an “autopoietic superintelligence” optimizing for capital, which has improved living standards but is critically misaligned with human/planetary flourishing. It references Moloch (the “god of Game Theory”) as a useful metaphor for these forces. The author argues that our cultural evolution has favored “power over wisdom, competition over cooperation, extraction over regeneration” and terms Nick Land’s concept of **teleoplexy** – runaway self-augmentation of a goal like capital – which renders human values obstacles. The piece calls for a movement to “align at large,” meaning to redesign incentives, norms, and institutions so that technology and markets serve life-affirming (wise) goals rather than undermining them.*

10. **Worley, Gordon (2024). “Finding the Wisdom to Build Safe AI.”** *AI Alignment Forum.* – *Worley (user name “TurnTrout” or “Seidoh”) contends that creating safe superintelligent AI likely requires endowing it with **wisdom**. He defines a “wise” AI as one that knows how to do the right things to achieve desired outcomes and avoids falling into intellectual/optimization traps. Because current AI alignment is hard (orthogonality of intelligence and values, Goodhart’s law etc.), Worley suggests that AI researchers themselves need to cultivate wisdom to have any hope of designing wise AI. He shares that he spent years practicing Zen Buddhism and studying broadly to become wiser, and proposes spreading this wisdom culture among AI safety teams. The post is part personal journey, part blueprint: it emphasizes introspection, virtue, and possibly integrating contemplative practices into the AI research community so that the humans behind AI are coming from a place of wisdom.*

11. **Arel, Jordan (2024). “On Artificial Wisdom.”** *Effective Altruism Forum.* – *Arel introduces “Artificial Wisdom (AW)” as AI that significantly boosts wisdom in the world. The post gives a working definition of wisdom as “thinking/planning that avoids large-scale errors” and “having good goals”. It discusses four scenarios combining AI alignment success/failure with presence/absence of AW. The conclusion is that having AI which can help generate wisdom (e.g., as advisors or by being itself more enlightened) would improve any outcome, unless trying to develop AW distracts so much that alignment fails. Arel suggests “strapping” wisdom to AI systems as they take off – meaning injecting wisdom-enhancing mechanisms early in AI development. They propose that as AI becomes more powerful, if it carries humanity’s wisdom with it (or pushes humans to be wiser via interaction), it could guide us through the transformation of the “Most Important Century” without existential disasters. This is one of few explicit attempts in EA/rationalist literature to operationalize wisdom in AI design and argue for its pursuit.*

12. **Vervaeke, John & Ferraro, Leo (2013). “Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom.”** – *This academic work links cognitive science theories to wisdom. It posits that wisdom fundamentally involves improving how we **realize relevance** – the ability to zero in on what matters in any given situation. It suggests that cognitive processes like relevance realization, insight (overcoming framing traps), and rational self-regulation are at the heart of wisdom. A key line: “Wisdom involves the enhancement of cognition (broadly construed)”. Vervaeke argues that wisdom is about overcoming self-deception and connecting with meaning. This paper provides a theoretical backbone for understanding wisdom as an adaptive, computational process the brain can do, bridging it with meditation and contemplative techniques known to improve insight. It’s a cornerstone for those blending psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy to naturalize wisdom.*

13. **Freinacht, Hanzi (2017). “Metamodern Spirituality, Existence and Aesthetics.”** *Metamoderna Blog.* – *Hanzi Freinacht is a leading voice on metamodernism. In this post, he lays out a metamodern approach to spirituality that acknowledges “the esoteric, spiritual disciplines and wisdom traditions East and West relate to real insights of great significance”. He advocates reconnecting to the “fundamental religious core of reality” without falling into either fundamentalism or shallow new-ageism. The metamodern stance he describes includes taking spirituality seriously, exploring higher states of consciousness, and **valuing mysticism** (direct experience of the divine or unity) – all integrated with a rational worldview. Freinacht emphasizes inner subjective development as “often the golden key to managing society’s problems”, highlighting that many modern societal issues stem from lack of wisdom/inner growth. This work basically argues for reintroducing wisdom (in the form of mature existential insight) into secular society, aligning with metamodern aims of personal growth and cultural renewal.*

14. **Anonymous (Octopusyarn) (2024). “A Headless God: The Structure of Metamodern Religion II.”** *Metamoderna Blog.* – *A guest post expanding on metamodern religion. It presents a “philosophical framework for Metamodern Religion” that attempts to integrate science, post-structuralist critique, and traditional insights. It highlights that major world religions share a core of **non-dual mysticism**: an ineffable ultimate reality (e.g., Tao, Brahman, God beyond images, Buddhist emptiness) that is beyond conceptual grasp. This common core is taken as a basis for a new form of spirituality that can unite people. The author speaks of “bringing together science and ... multiple cultural interpretations, including traditional and indigenous ones”. They propose meta-rational narratives that avoid dogma while preserving meaning. Essentially, this reference articulates how **wisdom traditions converge** (perennial philosophy) and how a metamodern outlook can hold them in a flexible framework. It underscores values like **meta-rationality** (acknowledging rationality’s limits and navigating between perspectives), which parallels wisdom’s integrative function.*

15. **Freinacht, Hanzi (2022). “10 Ways to Thoroughly ‘Solarpunk’ Society.”** *Metamoderna Blog.* – *Freinacht here connects the Solarpunk movement with metamodern politics. He argues Solarpunk – which he defines as a participatory movement for ecological sustainability with a reconciliatory spirit between nature and technology – has “massive transformative potential”. The article lists ways Solarpunk ideals (community co-design, renewable energy, urban greenery, etc.) can deepen democracy and reshape society. He calls Solarpunk a “gateway” into metamodern forms of society beyond current capitalist liberal democracies. For instance, involving citizens in participatory design of public spaces naturally forces them to engage in governance (what he terms **democratization politics**). Solarpunk aesthetics entice people emotionally, making sustainable futures aspirational rather than sacrifical. Freinacht warns that if liberal democracies don’t adopt Solarpunk earnestly, authoritarian regimes might appropriate its imagery for “islands of eco-utopia” that are not truly free. This piece effectively shows a practical avenue to integrate wisdom values (sustainability, participation, long-term thinking) into popular culture and policy via optimistic envisioning.*

16. **Wilson, Edward O. (circa 2009, quoted in various sources). “Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, godlike technology.”** – *This is a famous quote by biologist E.O. Wilson often cited to summarize humanity’s predicament. The full quote: “The real problem of humanity is: we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. And it is terrifically dangerous.”. Wilson’s aphorism encapsulates the idea that our emotional and social capacities (shaped for small-scale societies) haven’t caught up to the complexities introduced by modern institutions (which are still often antiquated and not globally coordinated) and especially not to the immense power of modern technology. This highlights the **wisdom gap** – our technological prowess (godlike) isn’t matched by wisdom in managing it. The quote is frequently used in discussions of existential risk and the need for rapid cultural evolution. It underlines why wisdom – updating our institutions and emotional skills – is critical to survival in the tech-empowered age.*

17. **Kegan, Robert (1994). *In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life*.** – *Although not directly cited above, Kegan’s work underpins many metamodern developmental ideas. He describes how modern life demands a **self-authoring mind** (Stage 4\) and even a **self-transforming mind** (Stage 5\) that relatively few reach. The concept that many adults are “in over their heads” because society’s complexity outstrips their mental development is essentially a wisdom issue. Kegan’s stage 5 (integrative, dialectical thinking) corresponds to what we’d consider wisdom (holding contradictions, empathy for many viewpoints, self-reflection). Metamodern axiology heavily draws on such developmental models, implying that fostering Stage 5-like cognition in more people (through education, etc.) is key. Kegan’s work is often referenced by metamodern writers to explain differences in worldview (traditional, modern, postmodern, metamodern roughly aligning with increasing orders of consciousness).*

18. **Club of Rome (2018). *Come On\!: Capitalism, Short-termism, Population and the Destruction of the Planet*.** – *The Club of Rome, known for Limits to Growth (1972), in this report calls for a “New Enlightenment” focused on well-being and sustainability rather than mere GDP. It’s a contemporary example of a transdisciplinary group advocating for wiser pathways. They emphasize systemic thinking, moral renewal, and balancing people-planet-profit (with planet and people first). The report serves as a practical blueprint for wisdom in policy – e.g., proposing regenerative economic models, value shift toward quality of life, and education for global citizenship. It resonates with metamodern axiology by merging scientific analysis with ethical imperatives and future-consciousness (exactly the combination a wisdom-led approach entails).*

19. **Inner Development Goals (2021). “Inner Development Goals: Background, Method and IDG Framework.”** – *The IDGs is an initiative paralleling the UN Sustainable Development Goals with a set of five categories of inner capacities needed (Being, Thinking, Relating, Collaborating, Acting). These include attributes like critical thinking, humility, empathy, resilience, and compassion – essentially personal and interpersonal wisdom skills. The framework was created by psychologists, leaders, etc., recognizing that without inner growth, outer sustainability goals won’t be achieved. It’s a real-world effort to operationalize the cultivation of wisdom and make it a policy conversation. The IDG report provides research and exercises for each skill, and it’s being adopted by some organizations and educators. This reflects metamodern ethos: integration of personal development with global development. It’s an example of treating **moral and cognitive development as key to societal progress**, as called for in this report.*

20. **Anthropic (2023). “Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback.”** *(Whitepaper).* – *Anthropic, an AI safety company, introduced **Constitutional AI**, a method where an AI model is trained with a set of principles (a “constitution”) that guides it to produce harmless and ethical outputs without needing a human in the loop for each instance. These principles include things like “choose the response most supportive of truth, knowledge, and empathy” and “do not give advice that could be harmful.” This is a concrete approach to instill a form of machine wisdom: the AI refers to a mini code of ethics. The paper reports that models trained this way are rated more helpful and harmless. While not perfect, it’s a step toward encoding wisdom-guided behavior in AI. The principles themselves were drawn from e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other documents. This can be seen as an early implementation of **wisdom-guided AI** alignment, aligning with the idea of Superwise AI by giving AI a semblance of ethical common sense.*
