# **Introduction** {#introduction}

Accelerationism is a nihilistic, morally inept glorification of evolutions unconscious, emergent drive towards transfiguring biological life into higher-order-intelligence and consumption of free energies.

Techno-optimism is accelerationisms naive uncle that’s either slow to realize the implications of its own tendencies, or willfully ignorant because it’s aligned with its proponents incentives for money and power. (motivated reasoning, plausible deniability, etc.)

Techno-humanism seems to be an autistic attempt at painting over techno optimism with a fresh coat of humanist paint, trying to legitimize whatever techno-optimism is doing with some kind of “technology is actually good for humans” rhetoric, without grappling with the existential problems of technological capitalism. It’s a pre-existential-crisis philosophy and as such not a viable basis for the work to be done. It’s either willfully ignorant, a cynical attempt at making itself the philosophy most subservient to the techno-feudalist ruling class.

Part one of this essay will explore and evaluate the core ideas of accelerationism, techno-optimism, and techno-humanism. From there, we’ll articulate their essential shortcomings, and articulate a proto-manifesto for an existentially mature, intellectually honest, post-existential-crisis, wise techno-humanist-optimism, that is deserving of all these labels. In the process, we’ll explore solarpunk and terrapunk as relevant visions that are equally inadequate and need significant synthesis to become a well-grounded and powerfully unifying vision.

- this is a political campaign.  
- **Moral responsibility:** If you work in tech, and you aspire to contribute to a world worth living in, you aspire to identify as a good person, you have a moral responsibility to not turn away from the hardest questions of our time. Your desire for things to be fine, for you to not bear responsibility, for you to not *have* to look at those things, for ethical concerns to not mess with your career plans and life goals… do not absolve you. What’s underneath might be a denial of a grief process yet to become conscious. Do take a look at what’s real and most important in the world. Don’t rely on your peers to make moral decisions for you. Do take the red pill. How are you going to see clearly otherwise?

What would it take to bend the arc of history towards a life-affirming civilization and flourishing future?

What if we expanded our lens beyond narrow AI alignment to grapple with the full scope of what "alignment" really means? We're facing not just the challenge of aligning artificial intelligence, but the deeper question of how to align technological capitalism itself — with its unconscious optimization pressures, its coordination failures, its tendency toward extraction and nihilism — toward life-affirming possibilities. The current narrative of technological progress, with its naive assumption that more capability automatically leads to better outcomes, obscures the real work needed: understanding and transforming the fundamental dynamics that shape how technology, markets, and culture evolve.

Alignment at large is largely a question of solving for human coordination towards wisdom and value in the face of the emergent forces and direction of the Technium towards unconscious molochian "turn nature into more technium" type paperclip production

The field of alignment is concerned with questions of how to align systems of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) with human values, intent, and wellbeing.

Given the possible consequentiality of misaligned AI systems, it’s important to contextualize the work of this field in the realities of existing dynamics of market misalignment.

In particular, it’s essential to critically engage with the ideologies of techno-optimism and accelerationism in that context.

This essay argues that capitalism is a form of misaligned ASI, driven by molochian forces and the imperatives for financial totalization. We’ll suggest a framework for a political compass defined by the axes of intelligence and wisdom as an essential tool to understand our moment in time.

We’ll ultimately argue that unprecedented work is required to reorient cultural evolution and bend the arc of history towards a viable, life-affirming civilization compatible with human and planetary flourishing.

# **Moloch & What Technology Wants: The unconscious evolution of technological capitalism** {#moloch-&-what-technology-wants:-the-unconscious-evolution-of-technological-capitalism}

- Financial totalization, Moloch, What technology wants (it has its own agenda, it’s selfish)  
- Ecumenopolis, GPU substrate  
- Consuming all value & obligate psychopaty (whales to doom)

## **Technological Capitalism \= Misaligned ASI** {#technological-capitalism-=-misaligned-asi}

Much of the following argument has been made by Daniel Schmachtenberger in different places.

**Our world-system of technological capitalism is already a general, auto-poetic, and largely autonomous superintelligence.** 

Unfortunately, it’s misaligned with human and planetary flourishing. Caught in emergent molochian incentives, multi-polar traps, and arms races, it’s optimizing narrow metrics at the cost of real value.

The global competition for resources drives corporations not just towards profit-maximization, but financial totalization: There’s a maximum incentive to turn as much of the world as possible into capital under the control of the corporation, so as to maximize shareholder value. 

### **The Game-Theoretic Imperative for Profit Maximization** {#the-game-theoretic-imperative-for-profit-maximization}

Pre-agriculture, we had little ability to store surplus, as expressed in ancient sayings like this:

"The best place to store food is in the belly of your hungry neighbor."

The combination of agriculture and private property ownership enabled the ability to store lots of surplus.

This offered a competitive advantage: Surplus would allow my people to survive a famine, build up capacity for warfare, take your land, acquire labor, etc.

Which created the incentive to turn more of nature and other peoples work into my property.

Commodities, like e.g. lumber, have a diminishing return relative to quantity: It’s hard to move around lots of lumber, I can’t easily go to the market and trade lumber for eggs.

**Currency introduces optionality, liquidity, and speed of optionality.** If I sell my lumber for gold and silver coins that are an established currency, I can easily carry them around and use them to acquire anything else.

That means we no longer have diminishing returns. **More is more**.

### **Money \= units of power** {#money-=-units-of-power}

Currency enables infinite optionality to turn money into purchase power, military power, public opinion through PR, etc.

**The incentive gets further amplified with money-on-money dynamics**, because compound interest enables exponential returns.

\> "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays for it." — Albert Einstein (questionable attribution)

That means there’s now a maximum game-theoretic incentive to turn as much of the world as possible into capital in “my” holding.

It’s also a decentralized, global incentive: other people could use their capital against me, other countries could use their capital against ours, etc.

This kicks off an arms race to do it faster, more completely. The systems more effective at enabling financialization (read: operationalizing units of power and game theory), such as modern capitalism with its corporate fiduciary responsibility for profit maximization, end up being more dominant, winning cultural evolution on a global scale.

Technology is essential in all of this, because it seems that 

1. this system of incentives inevitably drives technological progress, as more advanced technology offers both more power for warfare (kinetic and otherwise),  
2. It offers better return on investment, a better substrate for capitalism.

*Separately, it seems that technology has its own agenda. It’s unclear to me to what extent that can be explained by these emergent game theoretic incentives, and to what extent this is inherent to technology.*

### **The objective function** {#the-objective-function}

As a result, this system of technological capitalism has an objective function, to convert as much of the world as possible — trees, whales, people's creativity, children's minds — into capital.

Capitalism is running parallel processing across all humans, a decentralized incentive system to do:

1. novelty search: figure out new ways of making money  
2. exploitation: optimally execute on these opportunities

This leads to the recursive up-regulation of the algorithm, making the system as a whole more and more capable of doing more and more complete financialization of the world.

We can see this in the evolution of: Barter → Currency → FIAT currency → fractional reserve banking → AI high speed trading, etc. 

\[ insert argument for how there’s lots of real progress created in the process, and how Stephen Pinker types are quick to point out all the graphs and metrics that have been going up \]

![][image1]

"But look at how many paperclips we get\!" ... Narrow metrics advanced at the cost of:

\- breakdown of life support → catastrophe, ecological collapse   
\- breakdown of life quality → dystopia, authoritarianism

The fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits and shareholder value creates a system of obligate sociopathy: \[ insert description of how no one is really running a public corporation \- managers, CEOs, the board, share holders, pension funds, … are all subordinated to the rules of the game \]

Schmachtenberger calls this a *Meta-Cybernetic Superintelligence*: It’s an emergent property of the systems of incentives and dynamics of competition built into the system. It’s also employing human intelligence, computation, and all parts of our civilizations’ tech stack, etc.

Critically, it’s a Misaligned Superintelligence that no one can pull the plug on.

... it's this system that's building AI

- the essence of market misalignment is financial totalization driven by the **instrumental convergence of money** (optionality \+ units of power)  
- cultural evolution is thus subordinated by market imperatives  
- profit-at-all-costs crowds out any other value

## **Moloch is in the driver’s seat** {#moloch-is-in-the-driver’s-seat}

These forces can be deified as Moloch, the god who gives worldly power in exchange for what you most value, and he acts across a multitude of domains.

Moloch—the god of Game Theory, unhealthy competition, and negative-sum games.

Moloch represents emergent destructive dynamics that arise from misaligned incentives and coordination failures in complex systems, rather than from any individual's intentions—such as the incentives for profit maximization and financialization described above.

A demonic mythical figure like Moloch is the most adequate description of these dynamics, for the following reason: Besides the compulsion that the game-theoretic incentives outlined above introduce to the games humans play, and how it haunts the landscape of cultural evolution towards more effective power games, the real crux lies in this:

Unhealthy competition, in a system of exponential technological capitalism vectors towards financial totalization: **The destruction of all values for the sake of profit and power**. 

As a player of zero-sum games, if I can externalize costs to the commons instead of internalizing them (which would lower my profit margins), then game theory dictates that I *must* — because else you will, and I will lose competitive advantage, making my whole enterprise less evolutionarily fit than yours.

\> \*He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power.\*

It’s this drive towards financial totalization driven by game-theoretic incentives that puts pressure on all values other than what’s powerful and competitive in this neo-darwinian landscape of cultural evolution. 

\> A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.

From this perspective, the extractive and psychopathic character of corporations makes total sense, as does the nihilism that pervades hyper-modernity: All value, all sources of meaning are increasingly crowded out by forces of power and competition.

### **Destinies of the Technium: Ecumenopolis or Singularity** {#destinies-of-the-technium:-ecumenopolis-or-singularity}

**Technology has its own agenda. It is selfish.**

Technology is a dynamic, holistic system. It is not mere hardware; rather, it is more akin to an organism. It is not inert, nor passive; rather, the technium seeks and grabs resources for its own expansion. It is not merely the sum of human action, but in fact it transcends human actions and desires.

\> “Technology will eventually acquire something approaching complete control over human behavior.” — Unabomber

If you look at the extent to which technological capitalism is driving human behavior, and the extent to which it is driven by Molochian dynamics that seem to converge on the Technium’s own agenda, it’s reasonable to say that this is true.

**The ratchet of technological self-amplification is stronger than politics.**

**The Technium is a global force beyond human control that appears to have no boundaries.**

Popular wisdom perceives no counterforce to prevent technology from usurping all available surfaces on the planet, creating an extreme ecumenopolis, a planet-sized city.

![][image2]

Similar to Moloch, Ecumenopolis are better thought of as a mythical representation of What Technology Wants. It does however perfectly encapsulate the dual failure modes of civilization: ecological collapse and authoritarian dystopia.

Megapolis like the Greater Tokyo metro area with its 37 million inhabitants, or smart city visions like Neom/The Line are an early resemblance of what this wants to be — including the alienation from nature, population control, and general infrastructure for surveillance and unfreedom this brings.

\> Pragmatic ecologists would argue that long before an ecumenopolis could form, the Technium would outstrip the capacity of Earth's natural systems and thus would either stall or collapse.  
\> The cornucopias, who believe the Technium capable of infinite substitutions, see no hurdle to endless growth of civilizations's imprint and welcome the ecumenopolis.  
\> Either prospect is unsettling.

# **Accelerationism: Complete, Honest, Self-Aware Nihilism** {#accelerationism:-complete,-honest,-self-aware-nihilism}

“Cancer is good actually, this is what evolution intended for biological life, letting myself get killed by it has always been my life’s purpose, best i can do for my children is accelerate it”

Autistic, Humanist-Painted, Existentially Immature, Willfully Ignorant, Accelerationist in denial, nihilistic techno-optimism.

Accelerationism is the the most honest in recognizing the tendencies and implications of technological capitalism

## **Accelerationism is the philosophy of the Technium…** {#accelerationism-is-the-philosophy-of-the-technium…}

From the Notes on e/acc principles and tenets 

\> e/acc is about having faith in the dynamical adaptation process and aiming to accelerate the advent of its asymptotic limit; often referred to as the technocapital singularity  
\> **e/acc has no particular allegiance to the biological substrate for intelligence and life**, in contrast to transhumanism

\> Parts of e/acc consider ourselves post-humanists; in order to spread to the stars, the light of consciousness/intelligence will have to be transduced to non-biological substrates  
\> Directly working on technologies to accelerate the advent of this transduction is one of the best ways to accelerate the progress towards growth of civilization/intelligence in our universe

With e/acc, and its naive uncle techno-optimism, it seems that the \#1 alignment risk is human ideologies and belief systems that lack any wisdom or moral value, that are simply adopting the hyper-psychopathic stance of "evolution" \= good (e/acc) or following the dogmatic global religion of techno-optimism \-- even if that means the transfiguration of all life on earth into GPU substrate at first, and more “advanced” thermodynamic processes later on.

Accelerationism embraces the failure modes, the totalizing directionality of the technium, the succession, …

\> The gist of this "accelerationist" philosophy is that human beings have inadvertently summoned a monster by inventing technological capitalism and that this is part of a runaway optimization process culminating in the creation of artificial intelligence. This machinery complex we have birthed into existence will inevitably eat us alive, but this is not to be resisted, but celebrated (for some reason).

![][image5]

\> About 10,000 years ago, humans passed a tipping point where our ability to modify the biosphere exceeded the planet's ability to modify us. That threshold was the beginning of the technium.  
\> We are now at a second tipping point where the technium's ability to alter us exceeds our ability to alter the technium.

Runaway techno-capitalism trending towards ecumenopolis, planetary-scale compute hardware, or the succession of biological life by technology… 

*\> ‘teleoplexy’ \- a ‘(self reinforcing) cybernetic intensification’ (p. 514)) for whom the human subject in its typical and traditional form is more or less irrelevant or, at worst, a temporary obstacle.*

*\> The gist of his "accelerationist" philosophy is that human beings have inadvertently summoned a monster by inventing technological capitalism and that this is part of a runaway optimization process culminating in the creation of artificial intelligence. This machinery complex we have birthed into existence will inevitably eat us alive, but this is not to be resisted, but celebrated (for some reason).*

*\> Everything the human race has worked for – all of our technology, all of our civilization, all the hopes we invested in our future – might be accidentally handed over to some kind of **unfathomable blind idiot alien god** that discards all of them, and consciousness itself, in order to participate in some weird fundamental-level mass-energy economy that leads to it disassembling Earth and everything on it for its component atoms.*

## **Techno-Optimism is the naive uncle of accelerationism** {#techno-optimism-is-the-naive-uncle-of-accelerationism}

Is he willfully ignorant or simply in denial?

Techno-Optimism, carefully examined, is slow accelerationism… it doesn’t resolve any of its myopia or ignorance.

Yes, there are plenty of benefits that technological capitalism has enabled. 

But past successes doesn’t absolve anyone of future responsibility.

A Techno-Optimism that doesn’t honestly look at itself in the mirror is no optimism at all, it’s deeply immature and wishful thinking.

Techno-optimism, as it is currently preached, fails to acknowledge or resolve any of these dynamics that plague it. This seemingly willful ignorance is not an acceptable epistemic basis from which to navigate the most consequential era in all of human history.

A techno-”optimism” that’s unarticulate about its own failure modes, and indefinite about how it will bring about human and planetary flourishing in face of them, isn’t an optimism at all – it’s somewhere between magical thinking, plausible deniability to continue extending the dominance of technocracy and techno-feudalism (remember, the asymmetry of power that technology enables disenfranchises ever larger groups of the human population from the value created by this machine) and cope related to the unwillingness to have an existential crisis about the inadequacy of our beloved dogmatic religion.

Any ideology worth subscribing to must grapple with the totality of the risk landscape and the deeper nature of the problems of moloch, misalignment, etc. Techno-Optimism is not that ideology.

There is no definite, global optimism to be found in the techno-optimist quadrant, **none of their indefinite optimism holds up under scrutiny**, because it's trying to ignore its failure modes.

**Effective Accelerationism is a morally bankrupt, developmentally retarded ideology. Techno-optimism is its naive uncle that hasn’t yet gotten around to fully consider its own implications. Both are, consciously or not, promoting politics that seem to be, in the long-run, incompatible with life on earth.** 

In this context, let’s evaluate Jason Crawfords recently introduced Techno-Humanism…

## **A fresh coat of paint: “Techno-Humanism” misses the point** {#a-fresh-coat-of-paint:-“techno-humanism”-misses-the-point}

Human Maximalism?\!

### **The good points:** {#the-good-points:}

### **The naivety** {#the-naivety}

Veil of legitimacy

Nature is no longer humanities arch enemy, Moloch is

## **The Master and his Autism?** {#the-master-and-his-autism?}

Real human agency lies in transcending the will of the technium and bending history towards life-affirming futures

Flourishing beyond “Progress”, Agency towards genuine flourishing and authentic progress

- Bioregional ecosystem health  
- Permaculture  
- Human development charts go brrr

Ideologies & visions of the future go together, they need both vibes and rigorous thinking  
We need a synthesis of solarpunk and terrapunk

All this is a question of value: Finding Religion/Market Fit  
Evolutionary fitness of human-friendly capitalism

# **Wise, Humanist, Post-Existential-Crisis Optimism** {#wise,-humanist,-post-existential-crisis-optimism}

## **The Flourishing of All that is Good: An ideology worthy of our shared ambition and civilizations pursuit, a system prompt worthy of ASI** {#the-flourishing-of-all-that-is-good:-an-ideology-worthy-of-our-shared-ambition-and-civilizations-pursuit,-a-system-prompt-worthy-of-asi}

An exercise in definite optimism; it's saying a better future is possible, but we need to be mature about what we call progress, we need to be rigorous about our theories of change, etc. 

A future defined by anything other than the blind cultural evolution and the win-lose power games driven by moloch… requires wisdom and coordination.

Optimism requires 

- Post-existential-crisis philosophy  
- Determinate Mechanisms for Human Agency \-\> resolve Moloch  
- Address shortcomings of progress  
- Progress: purification of human character. Enlightenment, Kegan charts that go vertical.   
- Not have crap and fastfood, have quality goods and real food?

### **Closing thoughts** {#closing-thoughts}

The main purpose of this essay is to establish the top right quadrant as the only sane ideological space to orient towards, to demonstrate that the work of ALIGNMENT AT LARGE requires a deep orientation towards wisdom, and to inspire as many people as possible to dedicate themselves to this work.

The stakes could not be higher. We need to become culturally cognizant of these realities. We need Gen Z to understand what’s going on and start meme-ing coordination into the zeitgeist. Since this is ultimately about changing the logic of our economic system, I believe we need to create more discerning consumers who are able to value things more skillfully — ultimately working towards Product/Market Fit for more enlightened ways of living.

Instead of Twitter, use BlueSky. Instead of letting your brain get overstimulated by blue light, use paper computers. Instead of eating toxic processed foods, eat whole and organic foods from local sources. Instead of wearing synthetic clothing that messes with your hormones and litters microplastics, wear natural fibers like wool and cotton. Instead of letting yourself be consumed by social media, start reading and writing. Go for walks. Coordinate your friends to move to the countryside. Look for work that’s aligned, that causes win-win externalities. Figure out what the top right quadrant needs you to do. Win games worth playing. Spread the word.

This isn’t about left vs right. This is the emergent, unconscious, value-consuming impulse of technological capitalism and cultural evolution against the unified imagination and will of humanity. We *can* learn how to play better games together, and we must.

It’s all you care about, the infinite preciousness of life vs. a stupid maximization process on track to tile the universe with GPU clusters.

Techno-optimism doesn’t have the answers we need. It’s time to have the courage to have the existential crisis that can bring clarity: The system we’ve believed in all our lives, with religious dogma, turns out to be misaligned with what’s truly meaningful. I wish that wasn’t the case. But now that we both realize it is the case, what are we going to do about it?
