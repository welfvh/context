# **The Shadows of Modernity, Part I**

##### Consumerism and Demand Engineering are Incompatible with Human Dignity, Health, and Sovereignty

**Okay, the strategy for editing this:**

**Write *An Outline of Questions*. Have that be the next piece in the series. From there, segway into this piece. Rewrite this piece for clarity.**

Let’s start with the grounded, the practical, the personal: Why should *you* care?

The Third Timeline is not just a philosophical castle in the sky. It *is* that too, and it’s important we continue building it, but it very tangibly applies to you and everyone you care about. Your health, your spirituality, your relationships, your work — just about everything in your life can be seen through its lens. Ultimately, it’s a framework with which we can encounter the question of how to live well.

Techno-optimism and modernity at large would suggest that all you need for a good life is the willingness and ability to consume. Hand yourself over to the algorithm, “follow your heart”, live the life YOU *want.* Success is to make lots of money, attain status, acquire material possessions, possibly fame. 

### **Status and Supernormal Stimuli**

Social media and the susceptibility of our collective brain to status signals made it so that the .01% lifestyle of private jets, luxury cars, “Old Money” aesthetics and the generational wealth to back it up has become the benchmark for an entire generation.

Accordingly, *true alpha* is where the money is; in investment banking, high finance, private equity; entrepreneurship, trading, coaching, e-commerce; and ultimately, because attention is the resource to be mined: influencers and social media.

In this new world, money is the ultimate end, attention the ultimate means; so everything goes, whatever it takes. Porn is rewarded by the algorithm, so *degeneracy far and wide* is what we get. 

In this environment, an evolution of supernormal stimuli unfolds: A race to the bottom of the brain stem, with adaptive pressures that optimize for whatever is stickier, spikier, more inflammatory, more viral. Like gain-of-function research for biological viruses, except supercharged across billions of hosts, accelerated by (up until 2022\) some of the world's most advanced supercomputers, and trillions of dollars of market interest.

Just like capitalism is running parallel-processing across all economic actors, doing novelty-search and exploitation-optimization (looking for new and more effective ways of turning resources into capital) — the hypermodern logic of Limbic Capitalism is extending this to the playing field of extracting attention and manipulating the human mind.

The interests driving this phenomena are not just the ~~social media~~ *attention harvesting* companies: the logic of advertising and demand engineering has been around for about a century, and it’s inseparable from consumer capitalism.

### **A Century of Demand Engineering**

Modern consumerism is the brain child of Edward Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud, who turned his uncle's insights of psychoanalysis into the foundation for weaponized commerce.\[FN: Century of the Self\] At the heart of his work was an answer to a common concern by business people of post-war America: The concern that people would soon have all that they need, that consumption would reach an equilibrium, and people would stop buying. 

Bernay’s recognized that our subconscious can be targeted, we can be made to want things we did not previously want, our desires – and thus demand – can be engineered.

Not just did this hold great promise for commercial interests, the power to create a population with infinite desires and appetite for consumption — it also offered resolution to a growing fear and political concern that emerged from psychoanalysis and the world wars: *The order of civilization and democracy are fragile, the collective unconscious is a beast endangering the very foundations of modern society*.

The solution? If human psychology and desires can be shaped, if propaganda can be used to engineer consent, and advertising can be used to engineer demand, it makes possible the creation of a docile, purchase-happy, subservient population.

### **Asymmetries of Power between Consumers and Corporations**

It’s this asymmetry of power of demand engineering that I believe is at the heart of how modern advertising evolved from the 1950’s Mad Men to the hyper-sophisticated factory farming of human attention. 

Not just the attention companies, every single corporation selling to consumers benefits from an ever-increasing asymmetry of power in the relationship between corporations and consumers; benefitting from disempowered, atomized, dependent, compulsive, and addictive consumers who are desperate for their hits of dopamine, who have their attentional and cognitive faculties eroded, who’re in a real sense enslaved by desires … to the point that they don’t ever bother question the legitimacy of our political and economic order. Or, even if they do, it's part of a compulsive rabbit hole, the hyper-engaging content genre of conspiracy theories that disintegrate any notion of a coherent world view, driving paranoia and even deeper psychological paralysis. 

### **Limbic Capitalism Erodes Human Agency**

Needless to say all this limits their capacity for meaningful coordination and effective action in the world, renders them unwilling and unable of the deeper kind of reflection necessary for a life worth living, and even causes what we might call *neurological nihilism*: Since value and meaning depend deeply on our attentional faculties, if we’re unable to direct our sustained attention to an object or activity of our choosing, our distractibility indicates that we’re agnostic to the question of what to value. What we pay attention to is what we value, if we’re not in control of our attention, we’re effectively in a state of moral surrender, unable to value anything at all.

It’s fair to say then, that a sufficiently effective Limbic Capitalism is incompatible with human flourishing, that it by definition erodes human agency, and that it undermines the possibility of the kinds of cognitive sovereignty and democratic self-determination required for an open society and enlightenment values, and that it stunts and retards human development at large.

From this perspective, TikTok, Meta, etc are the enablers of a psychological, attentional, cognitive warfare of unimaginable scale and pervasiveness.

*I could go on an on about this. The specific harms to children; the dependency on super-normal stimuli; the analogy of a society raising 6-16 year olds to drink 500-1000 ml of vodka a day (or whatever the equivalent of 5-10 hours of TikTok screentime); the physical health consequences of blue light exposure, sleep disruption, EMF radiation on developing brains, etc. But for now, let’s move on to the physical world, and the new unit of political concern and vision: the body.*

*Let me just note here that these realities alone disqualify Techno-Optimism as an ideology, that the impact on human health and wellbeing is direct and obvious, that we will – hopefully – one day look back on this status quo as one of history’s most morally \[ bankrupt / … \] features. Choosing ignorance in the face of hundreds of millions of innocent children having their mental faculties ripped apart is straight up evil.*

## **Modernity and the Body**

The evolutionary mismatch of the modern world extends beyond the attentional and psychological. Obesity and chronic disease are rampant in a way that they were not before modern times. Yes, sure, we have medical care capabilities now that we did not have 100 years ago. But modern medicine’s approach to human health is reductionistic and incomplete.

There’s an aspect of techno-optimism’s disregard for nature’s wisdom, an epistemic ignorance, a lack of “green”, that is especially pronounced and well illustrated with these examples. 

The modern world tells us it’s entirely normal and acceptable to be inside under artificial light all day and night, to eat hyper-processed foods full of chemicals and seed oils, to drink fluorized tap water, to have petro-chemical fertilizers all over our produce and water supply, etc. 

Just like lead causes incredible damage to human health and intelligence, there’s a thousand micro lead crises all around us, impacting almost everyone’s health on a daily basis. 

*\> "I have no interest in Andrew Huberman's sleep shit. Like, no. His whole natural light, yeah we're not doing any of that. I don't see any natural light in here, and I'm very happy. It's a test of manhood as to whether you can have a blue screen in your face for three hours and then go to sleep. I don't understand why you would want to take shortcuts."*

If you’re not getting your daily credit card worth of microplastics, lead poisoning, seed oils and \[?\] you’re doing it wrong.

Microplastics, seed oils, blue light, sleep disruption, fertilizers are amongst the most pervasive toxins. Endocrine disruptors, sleep control, chronic stress, synthetic fiber clothing, …

The recent emergence of holistic health influencers is a sign of nature healing.

### **Carving out niches of health and sanity is hard work**

I’ve been fortunate to be born in Germany, as the son of alternatively inclined parents, which means I grew up with organic food, a sensibility for health related things, and a healthy dose of mistrust towards the defaults of the modern world.

And even so, with a well-formed, embodied intuition not distorted by early conditioning, I learned thousands of things about holistic health and wellbeing, about the health risks lurking everywhere under a veil of normality.

The amount of attention and insight it takes to understand all the risks facing us, the amount of neurotic insistence that this is important and to be prioritized, the resources required to eg. buy organic food, and more generally, consistently and vigilantly evaluate and disqualify available options, … it’s mind-blowing, and it’s probably unavoidable to most people.

*I want to get to the argument that this should not be an individual battle. Non-stick pans, plastic cutting boards, seed oils, chemical food dye, all these things ought to be outlawed, or at the very least get massive warning labels. I want to make the point that the logic of demand engineering extends to food, that addictiveness of all sorts can be built into what we consume. That the modern notion of revealed preferences in the context of all this engineering and pervasiveness is no longer a moral basis that holds. But really, I want to get to the point of Techno-Optimism’s* hubris*, the presumption, the naivety, non-attunedness: Why assume we can flood the world with plastics and have that be a good thing? Why would we focus on pharmaceutical* “cures” *for cancer and diabetes and heart disease, instead of reverting our diets and living environments to the best degree possible to human-friendly conditions? Why not focus on removing plastics from the world asap? Why not outlaw seed oils? Etc.*

*This also extends into the fundamental flaw of Liberalism and revealed preferences; “We’re just giving people what they want” is plausible deniability, not a morally wise position grounded in any sense of care or humanism.*

*And finally, from Machines of Loving Grace to Blueprint and Don’t Die, what’s incredibly irritating to me is the lack of attunement, the lack of “green”, sensitivity: Bryan Johnson arriving at the wisdom of natural fiber clothing through science telling him, instead of a simple intuition that maybe, nature knows best.*

*From there, two things can be observed:* 

1) There is a logic and wisdom to the body, to embodiment; that once you pay attention to how things feel in your body, you can become increasingly attuned to what actually feels good and healthy. And you end up wanting to have your own little homestead, growing organic food, eating it as fresh as possible, raising cows and chicken, wearing natural fibers, eliminating plastic from your property, drinking fresh mountain spring water, walking barefoot as much as possible, etc.  
2) You will still use technology, but you’ll want to be discriminate about it. From paper-like screens that don’t emit blue light and inflamed your nervous system to well made natural fiber clothing, to a chainsaw. It’s not black and white. There are many shades of grey, even on a monochrome display. And life becomes so much more colorful and vibrant; when the color palette of your home and wardrobe is natural dyes and materials, when your screen is not all candy, when your children haven’t once seen the insanity of color that is YouTube kids. 

Healthier, human-friendly technology — all our built environment, all things we use are technology in some sense — is possible. And it’s a question of how you choose to live, just as much as it is a question of what future we choose collectively.

That’s why the Third Timeline is deeply personal and practical. You can choose to start living in it today. The more we choose it, the more it becomes possible, attainable. The more companies build things that are human-friendly, the more brands invest in educational marketing, the more our collective imagination becomes capable of grasping what’s possible.

That’s why Solarpunk needs capitalism. Moral progress in cultural evolution requires finding product/market fit for more enlightened ways of being.

Welcome to the Third Timeline.
